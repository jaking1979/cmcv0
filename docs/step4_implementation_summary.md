# Step 4 Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

Step 4 connects the multi-agent coach system (Steps 1 & 2) to the user-facing Advice page, creating an intelligent, adaptive coaching experience.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/advice/page.tsx` - Frontend Integration
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `recentCoachTags` state to track active coaching patterns
- ✅ Updated `postToEventsAPI()` to properly send messages array
- ✅ Enhanced `postToEventsAPI()` to extract and store coach tags
- ✅ Added automatic plan CTA trigger when 2+ high-confidence coaches activate
- ✅ Updated `handlePlanRequest()` to show loading state and add confirmation message
- ✅ Enhanced plan CTA UI with gradient background and icon
- ✅ Rebuilt plan display component with:
  - Category grouping (Immediate/Short-term/Long-term)
  - Difficulty badges (Easy/Medium/Hard)
  - Numbered action items
  - Accept & Continue flow
- ✅ Added coach debug panel (enabled with `?debug=1`)
- ✅ Added manual "💡 Suggest Plan" button for testing
- ✅ Updated instructions modal to explain V1 features
- ✅ Passed `coachTags` to advice API for contextual responses

### 2. `/src/app/api/advice/route.ts` - Backend Enhancement
**Already Had:**
- ✅ V1 system prompt with coach tags support (line 37-68)
- ✅ Coach tags parameter in request body (line 158)
- ✅ Conditional system prompt based on `isV1Enabled()` (line 181)

**How it works:**
- When coach tags are provided, they're added to the system prompt as context
- AI can adjust responses based on detected patterns (self-criticism, distress, etc.)
- Only high-confidence tags (>0.6) are included to avoid noise

## User Experience Flow

### Standard Flow (V1 Enabled)

1. **User sends message** → "I feel like such a failure. I can't handle this stress."

2. **Backend analysis** (invisible to user):
   - Message sent to `/api/advice` → AI generates response
   - Response sent back to user
   - Message posted to `/api/events` → Coaches analyze
   - DBT Coach: Detects "can't handle" → distress-tolerance tag
   - Self-Compassion Coach: Detects "failure" → self-criticism tag
   - Tags stored and passed to next API call

3. **User continues conversation** (2-3 more exchanges)

4. **System detects** multiple high-confidence coach signals

5. **Plan CTA appears**:
   ```
   💡 Ready for a personalized plan?
   Based on our conversation, I can create a customized 
   action plan with specific steps tailored to your situation.
   
   [Yes, create my plan]  [Not right now]
   ```

6. **User clicks "Yes, create my plan"**

7. **Plan generates** (~2-3 seconds):
   ```
   📋 Your Personalized Plan (Confidence: 80%)
   
   Based on what you've shared, here's a plan focusing on 
   managing stress and building self-compassion...
   
   ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
   1️⃣ Grounding Technique [Easy]
      When you feel overwhelmed, try 5-4-3-2-1...
   
   📅 SHORT-TERM ACTIONS
   2️⃣ Daily Self-Compassion Practice [Medium]
      Set aside 5 minutes each morning...
   
   🎯 LONG-TERM GOALS
   3️⃣ Build Support Network [Hard]
      Identify 2-3 trusted people...
   
   [Accept & Continue]  [Dismiss]
   ```

8. **User clicks "Accept & Continue"**

9. **System adds follow-up**: "Great! I've noted your plan. Which action would you like to start with?"

### Coach Activation Logic

**DBT Coach activates when:**
- Distress signals: "overwhelming", "can't handle", "too much"
- Emotion dysregulation: "mood swings", "anger", "out of control"
- Interpersonal challenges: "conflict", "relationship", "boundary"

**Self-Compassion Coach activates when:**
- Self-criticism: "I'm a failure", "I'm terrible", "what's wrong with me"
- Shame: "ashamed", "embarrassed", "humiliated"
- Isolation: "I'm the only one", "nobody understands"

**CBT Coach activates when:**
- All-or-nothing: "always", "never", "every time"
- Catastrophizing: "disaster", "everything will fall apart"
- Should statements: "I should have", "I must"
- Avoidance: "putting off", "can't bring myself to"

### Plan CTA Trigger Conditions

Plan suggestion appears when:
1. V1 is enabled (`?v1=1`)
2. At least 4 messages exchanged
3. 2+ coaches have confidence >= 0.6
4. No plan currently displayed

Can also be manually triggered with "💡 Suggest Plan" button.

## Debug Tools

### Browser Console Commands

**Check recent coach tags:**
```javascript
// In browser console on /advice page
console.log('Recent coach tags:', recentCoachTags)
```

**Manually fetch events:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/events?limit=10')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Recent events:', data))
```

**Manually generate plan:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/plan', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: [
      {role: 'user', content: 'I feel overwhelmed and like a failure'}
    ]
  })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('Generated plan:', data))
```

## Known Limitations (V1)

- Events stored in-memory (cleared on server restart)
- Session cookies expire after 7 days
- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute per session
- Plan history: Last 10 plans per session
- Max events per session: 1000
- OpenAI API required (no offline mode)

## Success Metrics

Step 4 is successful when:
1. ✅ Multi-coach analysis runs on every message
2. ✅ Coach insights inform AI responses
3. ✅ Users receive intelligent plan suggestions
4. ✅ Plans are actionable and well-structured
5. ✅ Everything works smoothly on mobile
6. ✅ No regression in v0 behavior (without `?v1=1`)

## Next Steps After Step 4

Once Step 4 is validated:
- **Step 5**: Learning modules with progress tracking
- **Step 6**: Dedicated plan page with history
- **Step 7**: PWA features (offline, installable)
- **Step 8**: Push notifications
- **Roleplay Integration**: Connect roleplay scenarios to advice flow
