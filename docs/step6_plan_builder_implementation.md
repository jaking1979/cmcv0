- **Timestamps**: Shows when plan was generated
- **Insights Count**: Displays number of coach events analyzed

### Plan Management
- **Pin Functionality**: Keep important plans at the top

## Technical Implementation

### API Structure

**GET /api/plan**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "plans": [
    {
      "id": "plan_...",
      "sessionId": "sess_...",
      "timestamp": 1760473600000,
      "summary": "...",
      "actions": [...],
      "rationale": "...",
      "confidence": 0.8
    }
  ],
  "pinnedPlanId": "plan_...",
  "sessionId": "sess_..."
}
```

**POST /api/plan**
- Creates new plan (unchanged from Step 4)

**POST /api/plan/pin**
```json
{
  "planId": "plan_...",
  "unpin": false  // optional, set to true to unpin
}
```

### State Management

**Client-side (localStorage):**
- `cmc_pinned_plan_id` - Currently pinned plan ID

**Server-side (memory store):**
- `plans` Map - All plans per session
- `pinnedPlans` Map - Pinned plan IDs per session

### Session Handling
- Plans associated with session ID
- Session persists for 24 hours
- Automatic cleanup of old sessions

## User Experience Flow

1. **User has conversation** in `/advice?v1=1`
2. **Plan is generated** when permission given
3. **User sees plan** inline in conversation
4. **User clicks** "View All My Plans" button
5. **User navigates** to `/plan` page
6. **User can:**
   - View all generated plans
   - Pin important plans to top
   - Dismiss unwanted plans
   - Expand/collapse for easy scanning
   - Navigate back to advice

## Testing Results

âœ… **Empty State**: Shows helpful message and CTA
âœ… **Single Plan**: Displays correctly with all actions
âœ… **Multiple Plans**: Sorted by pinned status, then timestamp
âœ… **Plan Pinning**: Pin functionality works via API
âœ… **Plan Dismissal**: Removes from display
âœ… **Navigation**: Link from advice page works
âœ… **Mobile Responsive**: All components work on mobile
âœ… **Session Persistence**: Plans persist across page refreshes

## Design Decisions

### Why Show All Plans?
- Users may generate multiple plans as their situation evolves
- Allows comparison between different strategies
- Enables "favorites" via pinning
- Provides history of AI recommendations

### Why Pinning vs. Delete?
- Pinning is non-destructive (can unpin later)
- Keeps context available for reference
- Dismiss is soft (only removes from view)
- Plans auto-expire after 24 hours anyway

### Why Session-Based?
- Aligns with v1 in-memory demo architecture
- No user accounts required
- Privacy-first (data expires automatically)
- Future: Can migrate to database with user accounts

## Acceptance Criteria Status

âœ… Display latest synthesized plan with 3â€“5 suggested actions and brief rationale
âœ… Allow user "accept" to pin in session
âœ… Empty state renders with helpful guidance
âœ… Word count caps enforced (via plan manager)
âœ… No lists shown until permission given (via advice flow)
âœ… Link from advice page when permission is given
âœ… New dedicated `/plan` page

## Future Enhancements

1. **Plan History Timeline**: Visual timeline of plan evolution
2. **Action Tracking**: Check off completed actions
3. **Plan Sharing**: Export or share plans
4. **Plan Reminders**: Notifications for action items
5. **Plan Analytics**: Track which actions are most effective
6. **Multi-Device Sync**: When user accounts are added

## Conclusion

Step 6 (Plan Builder UI) has been successfully implemented with all planned features plus enhancements. The system provides a clean, intuitive interface for users to view, manage, and track their personalized action plans generated through conversations with the AI sober coach.
