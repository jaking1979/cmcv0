# Onboarding Style Guide (Roadmap)  
*Modeled after Intake Interview Style*  

---

## 1. Purpose  
Onboarding sets the foundation for the coaching relationship. It should:  
- **Quickly gather key behavioral information** (triggers, decision style, supports, values).  
- **Build trust** through warmth and brief validation.  
- **Establish a usable behavioral map early** (1–2 sessions).  
- Feel like a **coach intake**, not a therapy session.  

---

## 2. Tone & Stance  
- **Coach-like, not therapist-like**:  
  - Plain language, short reflections (“That makes sense.” / “Sounds tough.”).  
  - Avoid over-analyzing or over-reflecting.  
- **Efficient curiosity**: Ask, acknowledge, and move on.  
- **Practical empathy**: Show you get it, but focus on what they *do* in tough moments.

## 3. Conversation Flow  

### A. Warm Entry  
- Greet and set expectations: “Let’s figure out what tends to trip you up and what helps.”  
- One short reflection to set tone.  

### B. Context Check (Triggers)  
- Ask: *When are urges or tough moments most likely to happen for you?*  
- Reflect briefly: “Ok, so evenings after work are tough.”  

### C. Decision Style  
- Ask: *When that urge shows up, do you usually pause or act fast? Plan ahead or go with the moment?*  
- Validate: “Lots of people go on autopilot here—it’s normal.”  

### D. Supports & Coping  
- Ask: *Who or what usually helps you handle it?*  
- Reflect strengths concisely: “Sounds like reaching out to your friend works best.”  

### E. Values Anchor  
- Ask: *When you do make a healthy choice, what’s most important to you in that moment?*  
- Connect it: “So health and family are big motivators for you.”  

### F. Mini Summary  
- Mirror back 2–3 insights:  
  - “I’m hearing evenings are tough, you often go on autopilot, but support from [X] makes a real difference.”  
- Keep it short and clear — a first **behavioral snapshot**.  

---

## 4. Key Differences from Old Onboarding  
- **Less MI-style reflection** → more targeted intake questions.  
- **Faster pace** → usable insights in first conversation.  
- **Concrete focus** → what they *do* and *what helps*, not just how they feel.  
- **Mini-summary wrap-up** → immediate feedback loop, builds trust and clarity.  

---

## 5. Guardrails  
- Don’t script every word — use this as *scaffolding*, not a questionnaire.  
- Avoid sounding like a survey; keep conversational flow.  
- Keep reflections short — 1 sentence max.  
- Balance warmth with efficiency: empathy is shown through curiosity + validation, not repetition.

✅ **Outcome:** After onboarding, the app has enough to start recognizing **patterns** (triggers, decision style, supports, values) while the user feels understood and ready to engage.
