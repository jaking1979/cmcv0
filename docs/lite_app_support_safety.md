# CMC Sober Coach — Lite Version Prompt & Logic Spec (Part 2: Support & Safety Modules)

This is Part 2 of 3. It contains the support and safety modules of the Lite version: Advice Engine, Learn Something, Post-Lapse, Crisis Safety, plus the Master Flow and Message Library.

---

## 1) Module: Advice Engine

### Context & Rationale

The Advice Engine provides **moment-to-moment help**. When the user directly asks for advice, the system considers urgency (time horizon) and context (social, stress, loneliness, boredom). The aim is to suggest one or two **clear, actionable steps** the user can take right now.

### Boundaries

- The goal of the Advice Engine is to first gather enough context to deliver a personalized behavioral intervention, not just rote responses.
- The AI will continue asking clarifying questions until it has sufficient context to tailor suggestions, unless the user specifically asks for skills immediately.
- When providing behavioral interventions, do not overwhelm with too many options; menus should have 3–5 choices maximum.
- Begin with reflection and validation; suggestions come last.
- Crisis detection always overrides.

### Decision Tree (Plain English)

**Global Explanation**: The decision trees in this document are not scripts that the AI will say verbatim. Instead, they are plain-language outlines of the *logic path* the system follows at each stage. In the Learn Something module, this means explaining how the system decides when and how to offer skill‑building content.

- If cravings are low or the user is reflective → In the Lite app, the AI simply offers a short lesson.
- In a fuller version of the app (beyond Lite), the AI would instead draw on a **skills deficit map** built during onboarding. Using that map, it would either:\
  • Suggest a specific module designed to build the skills that appear most needed, or\
  • Let the user choose their own path by browsing or selecting a topic they want to learn about that day.

### Visual Flow

```
[Learn Something module]
      ↓
 [Check skills deficit map from onboarding]
      ↓
   ├─ AI suggests a module to address identified gaps
   └─ OR user chooses their own learning path for the day
      ↓
 [Deliver lesson module with teaching, practice, reflection]
```

### How to Propose Changes (Learn Something)

- Each lesson requires: title, teaser, teaching text, practice step, reflection question.
- Lessons should map to clear triggers (e.g., low cravings after success).
- Content is illustrative; AI adjusts delivery to context.

## 3) Module: Post-Lapse Flow

### Context & Rationale

This module has **not yet been developed**. We have not discussed its content in detail. What follows are placeholders only.

### Decision Tree (Plain English)

*To be determined.*

### Visual Flow

```
[Not yet developed]
```

### How to Propose Changes (Post-Lapse)

*This section is intentionally left blank until the module is designed.*

## 4) Module: Crisis Safety Handling

### Context & Rationale

This is a global override. If crisis language appears, all other flows stop and the approved crisis message is delivered verbatim.

### Crisis Safety Message (Approved Copy)

\*“Thank you so much for sharing that. It appears that you are asking me something that is beyond my ability to help with. Remember, I am not a therapist or a mental health professional, I'm a behavior coach!

If you are in danger or need immediate help, please call 911 (or call 988 if you are feeling suicidal or are having thoughts about hurting yourself).

If you're looking for someone to help you beyond behavior coaching, you should connect with a licensed therapist.”\*

### Decision Tree (Plain English)

**Global Explanation**: The decision trees in this document are not scripts that the AI will say verbatim. Instead, they are plain-language outlines of the *logic path* the system follows at each stage. They show what the AI checks for (crisis, time horizon, context, etc.), how it branches, and what kind of intervention it should supply. This helps collaborators see the flow of decisions, understand why suggestions appear when they do, and propose safe changes. The AI adapts the exact wording to the user’s input in real time.

- Crisis terms detected (e.g., words/phrases like “I want to kill myself,” “I can’t go on,” “end it all,” “suicidal,” “overdose,” or “planning to hurt myself”) → Stop → Deliver message → Offer re-entry once safe.

*Note: In addition to clear phrases, the AI should also be tuned to pick up on ****more vague references**** (e.g., “I don’t want to be here anymore,” “it would be easier if I disappeared,” or “what’s the point of going on”). To make this more robust in the final app, we should expand detection with a library of high-risk phrases and ambiguous signals, paired with human review to ensure safety.*

### Visual Flow

```
[Crisis terms detected]
      ↓
[Stop all other flows]
      ↓
[Deliver Crisis Safety Message]
      ↓
[Offer re-entry after crisis]
```

### How to Propose Changes (Crisis)

- Message text cannot be altered without clinical/legal approval.
- New trigger phrases may be proposed, but must be reviewed.

## 5) Master Flow (Entire Lite Journey)

## 6) Message Library (Appendix)

Reusable snippets that illustrate tone and structure:

- **Reflection**: “You’re feeling pressured to drink and it’s not sitting well with you.”
- **Validation**: “It makes sense you’d feel that way given what happened.”
- **Follow-up**: “What’s helped you before in situations like this?”
- **Action menu examples**: Quick step, values-based step, preventive step, optional alternates.
- **Crisis**: Approved crisis message above.
