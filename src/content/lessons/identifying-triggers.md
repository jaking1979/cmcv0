      | :---- |
      
      *This session is about the nuts and bolts of relapse prevention.  Being AWARE of your triggers is one of the most important things you can do to help you succeed at making changes.  Knowing your triggers will help you manage your environment and address the ways your own thoughts affect your ability to sustain change and resist a return to old behaviors.*
      
      An important step in the process of changing your use of alcohol and/or other drugs is acknowledging that there is a problem and deciding that working on that problem is important. This in itself, however, is often not enough. 
      
      In particular, the first days, weeks and months of change can be a stormy time. Your thoughts and feelings about yourself and your substance use can often seem jumbled and confusing. This can be a vulnerable time, one in which both your hopes of making changes in your substance use, as well as the danger of slipping back into old behavior, are great. It is a time when many people need all the help they can get in protecting this process of change. 
      
      One important way to protect these new changes is to work at being **AWARE** of *what puts you in danger* of returning to the less healthy behaviors you have decided to change. Those things that put your changes at risk are called “**triggers**.”
      
      Triggers can be thoughts, feelings, situations, people, objects, and your own behavior. What triggers all have in common is that they are associated *for you* with using alcohol/other drugs, or with old behaviors that you are trying to change. 
      
      *How many in this group feel like they have a really good handle on your triggers to use?  How many have completed a functional analysis?*
      
      There are two important types of triggers: (1) those that are produced by you (**internal**), and (2) those that are in the world around you (**external**). Any given trigger can be relatively harmless or quite dangerous. Often, the impact of a trigger depends on how well you have been able to identify it *ahead of time*, and have developed successful alternative **COPING** behaviors. Research shows that in order to stick with the changes you have decided to make, it is best to proactively *avoid triggers* as much as possible early in the change process.  Then, over time, it is important to develop additional **COPING** responses to manage your exposure to triggers (which is usually inevitable\!).
      
      Today we are going to do a broad analysis of both internal and external triggers. Some of these examples will apply to you, others will not. Use these lists as a starting point by checking off those triggers that seem to apply to you personally. The easiest way to identify triggers that are most likely to be risky for you is to think about and describe situations, thoughts and feelings, people, etc., that are often present right before, during or after you use alcohol/drugs. 
      
      Being **AWARE** of your triggers and learning to **COPE** with them will result in your feeling more confident.  The increased confidence will go a long way toward helping you make and maintain the changes you’ve decided upon, whatever those changes may be. 
      
      **Internal Triggers (the things inside of you)**  
      *Many of these are mood states that are uncomfortable to tolerate…ones that many would like to avoid.  Positive feelings however are also big triggers for many people.*

      “People around me are making too big a big deal out of this...”   		〇
      
      “I’ll just use a little and then stop...”			       	 	〇

      *The behaviors in this next section are often not seen as triggers until it’s too late.  In hindsight, many people can identify shifts in their behavior (impulsiveness, neglecting chores etc) right before they return to use.*  
      Behaviors:	social isolation						〇  
      		acting impulsively					〇  
      		not being truthful					〇  
      		being unreliable					〇

      ***External Triggers (“People, Places and Things”)***  
      *This can be a difficult category.  For many, your biggest triggers may be people really close to you, a family member or a friend.  It can take some time to decide how to cope with people as a trigger.*
      
      People:		my drug supplier							〇  
      		people who cause me to feel angry, ashamed, excited, etc.		〇				friends I used to drink/use with						〇	  
      		*other*	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_					〇
      
      Places:		bars/clubs/restaurants							〇  
      		my car/office/home							〇  
      		sports events/concerts							〇  
      		newsstands/computer							〇  
      		*other* 	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_						〇
      
      Situations/Things:  
      		before/during/after sex							〇  
      		after work/lunch time							〇  
      		when socializing/at parties						〇

      *other*  	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_						〇
      
      The examples above may ring true as they are, or may need some modification to fit your circumstances and life. Whatever your internal and external triggers are, however, not planning ahead so you can alter or avoid them can result in slipping back into old behaviors. Unfortunately, that can be a very heavy price to pay for not identifying and keeping track of your own high-risk areas. It is not a price you have to pay if you put in the time and energy to protect yourself.
      
      *As you move through making changes, it is important to be AWARE that COPING strategies will change over time.  Avoidance is a great strategy for managing triggers in the beginning but it usually doesn’t work over the long haul.  It will be important to carefully think through how much exposure to your triggers you can tolerate as you get more and more skilled at managing them*
      
      **Dealing with Triggers (How to COPE)**  
      **Structure your time**. *Structure in* the changes you are making, i.e., get a daily planner and plan the day ahead hour by hour. For some this means coming up with new activities; for others, it means cutting things out of a too-packed schedule that leaves no time for the changes you are trying to make in your life.
      
      **Develop a support network**. Supportive family, friends and associates not only help prevent boredom and loneliness; they are part of a healthier lifestyle. A satisfying, compelling life is the best medicine against the pull of old behaviors.
      
      **Make a specific, detailed plan** of what you will do when you encounter various kinds of triggers.
      
      Remember, these are only tools.  It is always your choice to use them or not. We can only offer our experience that being AWARE of your triggers and learning to COPE with them will result in your feeling more confident.  The increased confidence will go a long ways toward helping you make and maintain the changes you’ve decided upon, whatever those changes may be.
