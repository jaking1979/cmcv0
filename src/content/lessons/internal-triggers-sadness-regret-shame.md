      *This can be a painful session for some.  We are not trying to torture you\!  We simply want to give you the opportunity to think through and talk about all the issues that may affect your ability to succeed at changing your relationship to substances and/or compulsive behaviors.  These are painful feelings and cause many people to relapse.  We want you to be prepared.*
      
      **TRIGGERS**   
      Triggers are those people, situations, thoughts and feelings that you associate with your alcohol or other drug use. Just the sight/thought/smell/sound of that trigger is often enough to start a physical and psychological reaction *as if you had the alcohol/drug in your hand*. Once this has occurred, actual use may not be far away. There are two major types of triggers: **external** (people, places and situations) and **internal**. Today we will be discussing internal triggers.
      
      **Internal Triggers: Sadness, Regret & Shame**  
      Internal triggers are those thoughts and feelings that occur within us that might lead to using. Thoughts and feelings are often thrown together as if they were one category and include (1) sadness/regrets and (2) shame/humiliation. These are in fact very different states that need to be understood and dealt with in different ways if you want to prevent these feelings from acting as internal triggers to relapse. 
      
      Have any of you struggled with these feelings?
      
      **Sadness/Feeling “Blue” and Regret**  
      It is normal to feel sad or down at times, particularly early in the change process (1-3 months). What is most helpful is to be **AWARE** of these feelings, because they can be powerful triggers for using. Many people are used to the frantic chaos created by their use, and have never slowed down enough to notice sadness or regret.  Many believe the feelings are just caused by use rather than an underlying depression or real loss in their life (e.g., loss of time, relationships, health).
      
      Taking the time to reflect on how you feel, especially if how you feel is not so good, can be painful and difficult. It can also be crucial to sustaining change. For many people, the ordeal associated with excessive substance use or compulsive behaviors has caused great pain and havoc to themselves and those close to them. “Digging out” of this chaos will naturally involve not only finding the hopefulness needed to change, but also **TOLERATING** the sadness and regrets of damage done and opportunities missed. Taking the time to recognize this and experience the pain and sadness of it can ultimately help you move forward and unload some of this baggage. This is a difficult process, however, and should be done with the help and support of those around you, not on your own. 
      
      *Have you ever thought of sadness and regret as potentially healthy feeling states?  Do you see how being aware of them can help you move forward and toward positive change (e.g., I feel sad that my use caused me to lose my friendship to Tom, I will work hard to not let that happen to my other friendships).*
      
      **Shame and Humiliation: A Special Category**  
      Because of what you have been through, it is often true that the damage done (to yourself and others) while using substances or engaging in compulsive behaviors causes great shame or humiliation as you begin to change. This should not be confused with regrets and sadness, which are painful but reasonable responses to what may have happened in your life. Unlike those feelings, shame and humiliation are self-destructive responses that leave you no room to grow or move. Instead, they often lead to isolation, anger, and confusion over how to move forward. Feelings of shame are often accompanied by self-critical ideas like: “I really haven’t suffered enough yet,” or “The problem isn’t my use; I’m just a bad person.” Unlike sadness and regrets, dwelling on these thoughts and feelings leads nowhere fast (except to relapse). Experiencing the discomfort of sadness can lead *back to other people* and to positive connections; dwelling on your “badness” leads *away* from other people and into hiding. Learning to recognize the difference between these two types of emotions is critical.
