Many people have grown up in environments where anger was expressed in destructive ways and as a result they have a fearful response to it and have not learned effective ways to express it.  In addition, stopping or reducing the amount of substances you are using has an impact on your body and brain that may result in feeling more irritable or edgy for a period of time.  While irritability is normal and will pass with time, it can be difficult to tolerate and for many can lead to relapse.  Since anger is such a loaded topic for so many people we devote an entire session to it."

      *This is a tough session for many people, because anger is a tricky emotion both to tolerate and manage when you are first making changes in your substance use.  Many people have grown up in environments where anger was expressed in destructive ways and as a result they have a fearful response to it and have not learned effective ways to express it.  In addition, stopping or reducing the amount of substances you are using has an impact on your body and brain that may result in feeling more irritable or edgy for a period of time.  While irritability is normal and will pass with time, it can be difficult to tolerate and for many can lead to relapse.  Since anger is such a loaded topic for so many people we devote an entire session to it.*
      
      **TRIGGERS**   
      Triggers are those people, situations, thoughts and feelings that you associate with your alcohol or other drug use. Just the sight/thought/smell/sound of that trigger is often enough to start a physical and psychological reaction *as if you had the alcohol/drug in your hand*.  Once this has occurred, actual use may not be far away. There are two major types of triggers: **internal** (thoughts and emotions) and **external**. Gaining a full understanding of your triggers will help you have the **AWARENESS** you need to make real changes in your use of substances.  Today we’ll discuss internal triggers.
      
      **Internal triggers**  
      Internal triggers are those thoughts and feelings that occur within you that might lead to using. One very common internal trigger is feelings of anger. Below are some experiences that are associated with anger. Circle “Y” (YES) next to those that have commonly resulted in anger for you and “N” (NO) next to those that have not. Next, indicate whether this anger has led to use.
      
      *Remember, as we go through these, think through whether or not these triggers for anger have resulted in your decision to use in the past.*
      
      **Experience								Anger?		Use?**

      I am not appreciated at my job/by my friends.			 	Y / N		Y / N
      
      I missed my train/got stuck in traffic.					Y / N		Y / N
      
      I feel defensive about or ashamed of my use/relapse.		 	Y / N		Y / N

      Other \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_			Y / N		Y / N
      
      *Have any of you thought about how these anger triggers are related to your use?*
      
      *Do any of you try really hard to never get angry?  Anyone afraid of it or feel worried about feeling angry?*
      
      *Keep in mind that it is totally normal to feel angry at times…in fact anger can be a really helpful emotion.  It is simply a cue that something in your environment is not working right…that something needs to change.  If you deny it’s existence…you are at risk for staying in situations that are harmful too long...anyone have this problem?  Anyone stay in a relationship too long…hoping that things would work out or the other person would figure out what you need without you expressing it?*
      
      It is normal to experience feelings of anger. However, it is important to consider changing what may have become your automatic response to anger: using alcohol/ drugs. The first step toward that goal is to become aware of your anger and how it is associated with using. Once you are aware, then you can build **COPING** responses to deal with anger in an effective manner.  Remember, the goal is not for you to never get angry; everyone gets angry at times.  Instead, the goal is to learn how to manage your anger in a way that is not destructive to you. 
      
      *Another thing to be aware of is that anger is often easier to express and be aware of than other feelings such as guilt, fear and sadness.  It is energizing and stimulating and may make you feel in control for a moment rather than down, worried or bad about yourself.*  
      
      Often, anger is a response that is more comfortable than the feelings it is masking (e.g., feelings of sadness, shame, guilt or hopelessness). Again, it is important to understand the relationship that anger has with your using. In particular, it is critical to begin to see how anger has been and is connected to drifting towards or causing a relapse. By making these connections, you will have taken an important step toward managing your anger and preventing it from jeopardizing the changes you are making.
      
      *As you go through this process, it is really important to stop and see if you can identify feelings that may be under your anger…for example if you find yourself becoming angry and defensive after a slip…try to see if instead you are feeling embarrassed and scared.  The value in doing this is that anger and defensiveness often push people away while acknowledging that you are scared may allow you to ask for help…helping you get the support you need.*
      
      *You should take these sheets home with you and track your anger…it can also be really helpful to talk with your individual therapists about your relationship to anger…are you afraid of it and avoid to too long…do you express it in ways that are not effective?  By understanding these patterns you can begin to cope with your anger differently which will improve your ability to maintain the changes you are trying to make over the long haul.*
      
      **Exercise**   
      Discuss how people or situations make you angry and how anger has led to using.  Try to think of other ways you might express your anger to avoid using.
      
      Thinking it through: When you notice a flare-up of anger, ask yourself the question: “Is it more important to me to prove I’m right/feel I’m right, or to protect the changes I am making?”
      
      On this page, keep track of times between sessions when you feel angry at a person or situation.  Note the circumstances, who or what is involved, and your behavior.
