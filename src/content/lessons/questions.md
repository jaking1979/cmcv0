      | Building a Support System |
      | :---- |
      
      *This is an important session because the presence of a good support system is one of the best predictors of successful behavioral change.  Making significant changes in behavioral patterns is often very difficult and other people can provide encouragement and important feedback.  Many people however, have a hard time addressing this issue for a variety of reasons…this session will help you look at your current support system and give you ideas about how to further develop it or change it all together.*
      
      The excessive use of alcohol and other drugs can end up being quite isolating in several ways. First, as the intensity and preoccupation with use increased, you may have become increasingly isolated from important people in your life who did not share this preoccupation. Second, and conversely, your social circle (if one remained) may have become dominated largely by others who do share your substance use interests. 
      
      *Anyone have either of these problems…finding yourself isolated or surrounded by heavy substance users?*
      
      Early in the process of making changes, this can present a practical as well as emotional problem: associating with people who are using substances puts the changes that you are trying to make in danger; avoiding them can leave a large social and personal emptiness. In other words, if you stop associating with people who are using, you may be very alone.
      
      Stopping using can also create a significant increase in the amount of unoccupied time you have on your hands.  Using substances can require a lot of time and energy (planning ahead and anticipating use, buying, using, crashing/being hung over, and finally, putting out fires related to your relationships and responsibilities).  Stopping using can leave a large hole. 
      
      *Anyone find this to be true…an increase in time and a struggle to do something with it?*
      
      So…by achieving your substance use goals (e.g., abstinence) you may end up with a limited social network and unstructured, unoccupied time on your hands.  Unfortunately, but realistically speaking, this can create a recipe for a variety of negative paths to develop. These can include feeling lonely, painfully bored, anxious and depressed, with a strong pull back toward use. While uncomfortable, this period (including the discomfort) has great potential for positive change (e.g., finding new and meaningful activities and friends).  It requires however, a proactive push away from isolation and lack of structure *toward engagement in the world*.
      
      **Change usually Works Best with Support**  
      While this statement is factually true, early on, many people find it difficult to be with others. In any given moment, it can certainly feel more comfortable to be alone than to reach out. This can be the result of any number of reasons, including having protected a private, secret world for so long, feeling others will be shaming of you or feel burdened by you, or just feeling uncertain or insecure about who you are without substances on board. What is helpful to be **AWARE** of, however, is that being alone leaves you more vulnerable to relapse. Again, while there are a number of reasons for this (e.g., boredom or loneliness leading to a desire to use and change emotional states; experiencing trigger situations with no one to help to make it through that particularly tough minute, hour, or day), the fact is: positive support promotes and helps maintain change.   
      
      **What You Can Do**  
      Developing a support network is an important **COPING** response, especially during this normal period of loneliness and self development. Often, people begin to build a support network through a treatment program or other programs such as AA and NA. Many people (not all), find it comforting to be around others who are openly struggling with substance use problems at various stages, and who can share their experience, problems and hope. Others become involved in spiritual or reflective activities, such as church or meditation. Many people try to re-establish family relationships or friendships that were damaged or lost due to their use. Other people involve themselves in activities that are positive: for instance, going to community activities, church activities, exercise, volunteer work, hobbies, etc.  Some people do all of the above.
      
      *How are all of you trying to cope?*
      
      **The Hardest Part is Taking the First Step**  
      Keep in mind that once you take a chance and make the initial effort, it becomes easier to try new things and new ways of being. You need to be ready to try several new things until you find activities and people with whom you feel comfortable. You should also expect to have to **TOLERATE** feeling like a fish out of water in these new ventures for a while. This is normal with any new activity, but you can feel particularly vulnerable and uncomfortable when emerging from the protected world of alcohol and drug use. However, once you begin to establish a supportive network, coping with life without substances does start to become easier.
      
      *Anyone here ever think of using as providing a protected world?  We used that description purposely to make note of the issue many people underestimate…stopping substance use requires that you interact with new people and try different things.  For most people, using substances provides a certain routine…you know what to expect, how much you need, where to do it, how long it will last.  People on the other hand are unpredictable…they have their own agendas and feelings… and trying new things can be scary and intimidating.  By acknowledging these feelings and realizing how normal they are, we hope you can push through the sense of hopelessness that many people often experience as they try to make changes in their use of substances.*
      
      # **Questions**
      
      # *So, we really want you to think through the following questions because they can help you become more AWARE of the difficulties you may be having in developing a social support system.*
      
      1\) Do you have people who are supportive of the changes you are making? Who are they?
      
      *Keep in mind that support can come in a variety of forms…maybe it’s direct support such as someone who knows what you are going through and can hear about the details…maybe it’s more subtle, like someone who is fun to go to the movies with as a distraction who may not even know you are having a hard time.*
      
      2\) What work have you done to establish a support system?
      
      3\) What is most difficult for you so far in trying to establish new relationships and activities in your life?  
      *So, whats  hard about this process…is it hard to ask people for their time and interest, do you think of yourself as a loner, are there difficult emotional things to repair in your relationship before they will feel more supportive…*
      
      4\)  Have you found yourself avoiding people who could help you because you do not want to “worry” or “burden” them?  
      *This is a big one…a lot of people feel very guilty about asking for help…it’s important to know your automatic assumptions about asking for help so that you can challenge your own thoughts.  If your thought is…”I don’t want to worry “ them…challenge your thought by asking yourself…”which will cause more worry, me asking for help before I get in trouble, or me asking for help when I have already slipped off my goals”*
      
      *What are some things you can say to yourself to challenge your own assumptions?*
      
      5\) What positive activities have you thought about or begun to develop? What gets in the way of developing these?
      
      *This is another very important issue…you may be full of great ideas but in the end find yourself talking yourself out of getting started with anything.  It’s again, important to identify you thoughts…do you set the goal of taking a yoga class…and then talk yourself out by saying “I’m too tired”, “I’ll go tomorrow”, “I need to lose weight first”.  If you can identify these thoughts you can then start to challenge them or at least see them for what they are…blocks to achieving your goals.*
      
      *Coming to this group is a great first step to developing a social support network…but we strongly encourage you to begin developing your life outside of CMC so that it will be firmly in place when you decide to step down in treatment.  Since most people have a long period of trial and error in finding the supports that will work for them, we recommend that you start working on these issues while you have the encouragement of group.*
