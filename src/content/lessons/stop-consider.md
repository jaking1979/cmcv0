First, it is about increasing your awareness of what is going on when you are having cravings or contemplating a return to old behaviors.  In order to not respond to the impulse to use you will have to identify coping skills that help you pause so you can think things through.  Finally, you will have to tolerate the feeling of the impulse as you attempt to make a good decision for yourself.  This can all be a lot of work but we hope walking through ways to change your thinking will help you resist the impulse to return to old behaviors."

      *This session addresses all 3 parts of ACT (awareness, coping, tolerating).  First, it is about increasing your awareness of what is going on when you are having cravings or contemplating a return to old behaviors.  In order to not respond to the impulse to use you will have to identify coping skills that help you pause so you can think things through.  Finally, you will have to tolerate the feeling of the impulse as you attempt to make a good decision for yourself.  This can all be a lot of work but we hope walking through ways to change your thinking will help you resist the impulse to return to old behaviors.*
      
      Despite all your best efforts to change your use of substances, at some point you are likely to find yourself in a quandary, where different parts of you want different things.  One part of you really wants to change, the other part really wants things to stay the same.  This place of ambivalence is natural and is to be expected…as making significant life changes can be a long and sometimes complicated process.
      
      A significant part of change is behavioral (e.g., avoiding triggers, making new friends, dealing with feelings differently). It is important to realize however, that your decision-making process will have to change as well. When/if you find that *wanting to use/drink* turns into *planning to use/drink*, we have found that it is very important to STOP and CONSIDER as soon as possible.  
      
      **STOP &** **CONSIDER**
      
      Stopping to consider your options provides you a bit of a buffer between your thoughts/feelings (wanting to use, having cravings) and your actions (taking a drink, calling the dealer).  Acting on reflex or on impulse (which is what action without consideration often is) can have a very negative effect on your sense of self-worth and can make you feel that you are “out of control.”  
      
      *People often underestimate the negative impact that responding to impulses has on one’s self-esteem.  Having the thought of “I can’t believe I gave in again” can really erode confidence and optimism.*
      
      Of course, acting on impulse can also make you feel like you are taking a break from the hard work of consciousness.  While the immediate effect of “shutting off” or “numbing out” might provide temporary relief, the longer-term effects (i.e., feeling “out of control”) can often mean a chronic feeling of disappointment with yourself and detachment from your larger goals in life.  We think that allowing yourself a moment to stop and consider will lead to feeling more in control and feeling like you have more ownership of your life.
      
      As you move through the change process, try to allow yourself to make considered decisions instead of acting only on impulse. Stop a minute and consider the reasons for, as well as the costs and benefits of, your actions. If you then decide to drink/use despite this consideration, you will at the very least have learned something about how the process of change is working for you.  Most importantly, you will learn more about how your thoughts and feelings are involved in your decision-making process regarding alcohol and/or drugs.
      
      At CMC, one of the reasons we focus on increasing your **AWARENESS** is to give you the armor and ammunition for the many battles you will encounter as you try to change your behavior patterns. Awareness can help you to ask yourself and answer the questions involved in making considered decisions.  The boxes below illustrate a way of thinking through the decision to use.  While your ultimate action is always your choice, we believe that slowing down to really ask yourself these questions will help you make decisions you can feel good about…
      
      *This can be a lot to go through as a group.  As we run through these, pay attention to the questions that you maybe never ask yourself.  Pay attention to the questions that you think will help you keep the motivational balance tipped in the right direction.*
      
      | Benefits of using/drinking: What feels compelling about using/drinking right now? What feelings are you having right now that make using/drinking seem okay? What thoughts are you having that make using/drinking feel appealing? If using/drinking right now *does* fit into your larger goals, what can you do to make sure your use keeps to your goal/limit?  What might stand in your way of meeting this goal?  | Costs of using/drinking: What feels bad about using/drinking right now? What feelings do you think you will have about yourself tomorrow?   What thoughts will you have about yourself tomorrow if you decide to use/drink now? What is less likely to be accomplished in your life if you decide to use/drink now?    |
      | ----- | ----- |
      | **Benefits of NOT using/drinking:** What feelings will you have about yourself tomorrow if you decide NOT to use/drink right now? What thoughts will you have about yourself tomorrow if you choose NOT to use/drink right now? What might be improved if you decide to not use/drink right now? Is there anything that is more likely to be accomplished if you decide not to use/drink right now?  | **Costs of NOT using/drinking:** What negative things do you imagine or fear might happen if you do not use/drink right now?  |
      
      Finally, ask yourself:  What alternatives to using/drinking are you **not considering**   
      (e.g., distracting yourself with something, calling for support from someone, doing something else that would be calming or satisfying)?  
      
      *It can be helpful to keep these questions handy and look at them frequently.  You will only be able to ask these questions in the moment of impulse if you have rehearsed them.  These are very logical questions that will tap into your reason and judgment…which is in direct competition with the more emotional side of you that wants to give into the impulse.  Your ability to counter the strong pull of craving states will require that you practice more logical thoughts….and practicing during periods of low stress or impulsivity will help you access it when you are in a tough spot.*
