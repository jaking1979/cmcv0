      *This is an important session because managing and changing your relationships with your family will have a big effect on your ability to make significant behavioral changes.  As we go through this session keep in mind that when we refer to “family”’ we are referring to a wide range of relationships…significant others, parents, siblings, friends…it really about the people closest to you and those most likely to be concerned about your well-being.*
      
      The use of alcohol and other drugs can affect many areas of our lives, including our relationships with our families. “Family” may mean something different to each person, and may include spouses, partners, friends, children, parents, etc. By the time you arrive at the point of seeking treatment, you are often having a series of difficulties with these most important people in your life. These problems are not only painful to deal with, but also take time to work out while you are making changes in other areas of your life.
      
      Today we are going to begin to explore the relationship between drug and alcohol use and family relationships. It is important to be **AWARE** of how your family is reacting to your drug and/or alcohol use, as well as to your treatment, whether it is supportive, angry, mistrustful, understanding, or all of the above. All of these reactions will have an impact on you…what matters is being aware of what the impact is\! Review the following list and check those items that apply to your family:
      
      *As we go through these…keep in mind that family members can be both extremely helpful and potential very unhelpful as you try to make changes in your use of substances.  For example, family member may have very strong feelings about your use of substances…feelings that may get in their way of really helping you.  For instance, they may be very worried and concerned but express themselves in a way that sounds judgmental and angry.  Figuring out family communication patterns is usually one of the most important steps toward success…so, let’s figure out how each of your families deals (or doesn’t deal with) with your use.*
      
      My family:
      
      \_\_\_ wants to think I don’t use/don’t use much  
      \_\_\_ knows of my use, but does not speak about it  
      \_\_\_ tries to stop me from using  
      \_\_\_ gets angry and stops speaking with me  
      \_\_\_ is angry but is not telling me about it  
      \_\_\_ seems supportive one day and not the next  
      \_\_\_ tells me I need to handle this on my own  
      \_\_\_ is over-involved in my treatment/plans for change  
      \_\_\_ uses/drinks as well  
      \_\_\_ does not know of my use  
      \_\_\_ does not see my use as a problem  
      \_\_\_ does not trust me  
      \_\_\_ is very involved in my life/treatment  
      \_\_\_ is not involved in my life because of my use
      
      **The Family Stew**  
      As we can see, family members may be having a series of reactions to your use and treatment that have built up over time. For many, there is a high degree of mistrust based on a history of dishonesty and miscommunication. In addition, family members may have misconceptions concerning your current treatment and the changes you are making. For example, they may not understand why you need to go to treatment so often, or why you need to take time to develop positive activities that may not include them. At times, these reactions may not seem rational or be helpful in the present, but they will occur nonetheless.
      
      *Anyone in the group having these experiences…sometimes family members are over involved or cannot help but place demands upon you even though you don’t feel ready…sometimes they can be really under involved…almost walking on eggshells which can have the effect of making you feel bad and uncomfortable.*
      
      In addition, as you progress in making changes in your life, your family may not understand what you are experiencing or how difficult it is for you. When treatment works well, people go through many powerful and personal changes that family members may be surprised by and may not understand. Sometimes family members continue to react to you as though you were behaving in old ways because that is what they have learned to expect from you. It is important to understand that your relationships will change while you are trying to create a healthier lifestyle. This change process can be slow, and it requires attention, acknowledgement and, *very often*, **TOLERANCE** and patience.
      
      *This is often a big problem…by the time people enter treatment, family members are often very frustrated, angry and even burned out.  So when you start treatment, they are ready for things to change QUICKLY.  They often underestimate how hard it is and how you have to change almost every aspect of your life in order to be successful.  Anyone feeling pressured?*
      
      *Another common problem is being accused of using even when you are not….this is a tough one since being accused can feel “all too familiar” but also humiliating and maddening.  It is important that you be aware that your family is going through changes as well…they have their own automatic impulses and assumptions.  Just as you get triggered to use even though you don’t want to…their anxiety about your use can get triggered even though they may know you are really trying to change..  Anyone in the group have this experience?*
      
      Despite the time and patience required, however, the clinical and research evidence is very clear on this topic: in changing addictive behaviors and lifestyles, involving significant others in the process *greatly* increases the odds of doing well. In this way, involving your family is a powerful **COPING** tool that can be available to you. But: it is a complicated tool that needs to be used at your own pace, thoughtfully and with care and patience. We think, however, that if you choose to involve your family, you will begin to feel much more confident in your ability to change and to *maintain* those changes. 
      
      **Questions**
      
      1\) How is your “family” reacting to your involvement in treatment?
      
      2\) Is it difficult for your family to trust you? How do you react to this?
      
      3\) How is your family helpful in your efforts to make more positive life changes? How are they not helpful?
      
      4\) What can you do to help the process of reestablishing trust?
      
      5\) What role, if any, do you want your family to have in your treatment? List out the potential costs and benefits of such involvement.
      
      Families often need help in understanding and adjusting to the changes you are making, as well as in learning how to take care of themselves. You can help them by suggesting they talk with someone themselves, either about CRAFT (Community Reinforcement and Family Training) or family support options in another treatment setting. 
      
      You can also suggest that they read “***Beyond Addiction:  How Science & Kindness Help People Change***,” by Drs. Foote, Wilkens and Kosanke.  The book is pragmatic and kind, and meant to help loved ones wanting to make a difference and help enact change.  The can also go to:   the20MinuteGuide.com  for more information on ways to help.
