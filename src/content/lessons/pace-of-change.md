      People entering treatment come for a variety of reasons, with different problems, different situations, and with different goals. Many people, however, think they should have a particular attitude about changing their own addictive behaviors. For example, many people think that they should be positive they want to change, they should express no second thoughts about making changes in their life, and they should be ready to make any and all changes right now.
      
      *Anyone here felt these “shoulds”.  Anyone felt the pressure of managing other people’s expectations about this process?  Does anyone here put too much pressure on themselves?*
      
      We want to pause here long enough to say the following: At a time when you are beginning the very difficult process of change, these “should”s just add extra baggage. In fact, it is quite normal to experience ambivalence about changing old behaviors. The real issues (the ones that matter at 2:00 am, when you feel those strong cravings to use) to be **AWARE** of are the following:
      
      * What are the changes that make sense for you  
      * What are the changes you can really stand behind for yourself today
      
      
      In this session, we will examine how you feel about changes and the pace of these changes, without all the “should”s.
      
      The changes each person makes are part of a personal journey defined by many factors. Most importantly, each person must go through these changes at his/her own pace.  Some stop using and never go back. Others change slowly over time, and though they may want to stop completely, it might take several episodes of using before they are able to do so. Some begin the long and difficult process of lifestyle change; others stay focused on “just not using right now.”
      
      The point of all this is that we strongly suggest you try not to compare your pace and style of changing to other people’s pace. Why? Because you are bound to set yourself up for either unjustified pessimism or optimism. What is most important is to stay in tune with your own pace, and to establish a way of changing that you can sustain.
      
      *Have any of your been aware of comparing yourself to others and having these things happen, either too much pessimism or optimism?*
      
      While the pace of change is individual and personal, it can be helpful to be aware of commonly experienced “stages of change.” Below are several stages that people often go through when trying to make changes in their lives. You may identify with some of the stages, either now or from other points in your life. 
      
      *As we go through these stages, keep in mind that these are common stages for all behavioral change.  Going on diets, changing communication patterns, starting to exercise.  In addition, it is important to be aware that they are not static or linear.  You can go through a stage, fall back, skip stages…they can happen quickly or quite slowly.  Realizing how normal they are can help you manage your expectations and appreciate the complexity of making long-lasting change.*
      
      **Precontemplation:**  At this stage, you have no intention of changing your behaviors and you do not really feel that you have a problem. If you are here in treatment, it is often because there is some external pressure to be in treatment. This may make it difficult for you to define what you want to work on in treatment, which in turn often makes being in treatment in this stage a frustrating experience. 
      
      **Contemplation:**  This is a stage where you are starting to consider the impact your substance use has had on your life in a more serious way, while typically also feeling quite ambivalent. You are aware a problem exists but you are not sure you want to do anything to change the problem. You are beginning to add up the positive and negative consequences of use in your daily life, but may feel too overwhelmed to make real changes. 
      
      **Preparation:**	This is a stage where you are prepared to make changes based on your evaluation of the impact of substance use in your life, but you have not fully decided how to accomplish these changes, and what your goals are going to be. For example, you may have decided to change by going to support group meetings, but you haven’t decided which group is right for you, or for how long you’d like to stop using. 
      
      **Action:** In this stage, you are modifying your behaviors and are working at changing your life. This often involves devoting a good deal of time and effort to making changes, as well as an accompanying sense that you are on a path you feel good about for yourself.
      
      **Maintenance:** This is the stage where people work to prevent a return to old behaviors and to maintain the gains made during the action phase. This stage still involves a good deal of effort and dedication of time and energy.
      
      So what stage of change do you think you are in?  Can you see how people you know may be in different stages?
      
      **Suggestion:** Whatever stage you most identify with, the important point is to understand this stage and allow yourself to progress at your own pace, whether it is the same or different from the pace of those around you.  
      
      **Exercise**  
      1\. Discuss whether you can relate to any of these stages and see if other group members agree with where you are at.
      
      2\. Discuss the types of goals you are willing to work on based on the stage you are in. 
      
      3\.  As you listen to your fellow group members…do you remember being at a different stage?  Can you think of the events/situations that helped you move into a different stage?
      
      Remember that your level of motivation may fluctuate throughout treatment. You may feel quite secure in the changes you are making at times. There may be times, however, when you find yourself struggling more because of life pressures, etc. The important thing is that you try to be **AWARE** of what you are experiencing and set goals that are realistic. In addition, when you are feeling less motivated you might need more support (more support group meetings, more contact with friends/ supports, more structure in your life, etc.). Change is difficult for everyone. Do what you can, and remember to make use of the support around you.
