Using substances can cause you to become very isolated, either because you are only around other users and when you stop there is no one to spend time with. Or because family and friends have gotten increasingly upset, frightened or angry. It can take some time to identify sources of support but it is worth pushing yourself to examine this area closely because it is one of the single biggest predictors of success in making change and I want you to be successful!"

Sometimes that is appropriate and helpful, but sometimes what you need is a lot more subtle."

      # Asking for Help
      
      Asking for help can be very difficult for a variety of reasons. For example, some people feel ashamed or embarrassed to ask for attention and support. Others don't know what to ask for, and some don't know how to ask for support in a direct way that ensures their needs will be met.
      
      However, the evidence from many areas of behavioral change (substance use, exercise, diet) is that asking for help from others is associated with making and maintaining successful change.

      ## Identifying Ways People Can Help
      
      The first step is to identify **specific ways specific people** can help you. Keep in mind that certain people may be helpful in some ways and not others. Be specific!
      
      | Ways of Helping | Who can Help |
      | :---- | :---- |
      | Distracting you during tough periods | _________________________ |
      | Tolerating you when you are irritable or down | _________________________ |
      | Openly appreciating you for how well you are doing | _________________________ |
      | Spending time with you during difficult moments or hard days | _________________________ |
      | Accepting you when cravings are really bad | _________________________ |
      | Letting you know how proud/happy they are that you are trying | _________________________ |
      | Not nagging or pushing you to change faster than you feel you can | _________________________ |
      | Not giving up on you if you lapse to old behaviors | _________________________ |
      | Letting you complain about how hard it is to make changes | _________________________ |
      | Respecting your needs (not tempting you, not asking you to engage in risky behaviors) | _________________________ |
      | Doing change-supporting activities with you | _________________________ |
      | Other: _________________________ | _________________________ |
      
  - title: "Identifying Sources"

      ## Identifying Sources of Support
      
      The next step in asking for help is to identify potential sources of support. Think of people in the following categories who could be supportive of your changes:
      
      * **Family members:** _________________________________________________
      
      * **Friends:** _________________________________________________
      
      * **Co-workers:** _________________________________________________
      
      * **Fellow group members:** _________________________________________________
      
      * **Professionals (MD's, therapists, etc.):** _________________________________________________
      
      ## Identifying Potential Problems
      
      As we discussed, asking for help from friends and family members may be tricky for a variety of reasons. For example, you may have used substances with them, or they may have significant life problems of their own. Keep in mind that they may not be able to give you too much encouragement if they are having a hard time themselves!

      ## How to Ask for Help
      
      **1. Be specific.**
      
      Once you have identified your triggers/times when you may be more vulnerable, ask for specific help at specific times. Eliminate misunderstanding: close the gap between what you mean and what others may think you mean.
      
      **2. Set limits.** For example:
      
      * "Please don't smoke while you are with me."
      * "Don't ask me to join you for a drink."
      * "If I ask to bum a cigarette, don't give it to me (no matter how much I plead)."
      
      Learn to ask for things in a friendly and cooperative way ("Positive Communication Skills"), not in a demanding and angry way. You get more bees with honey than vinegar!

      ## Final Tips
      
      **3. Plan.** Come up with concrete plans to manage times when people are not able to provide the help you need.
      
      **4. Educate.** Let people know that some of the things you need early in this change process (e.g., not having a drink while having dinner with you) won't necessarily last forever. Explain to others the effect their behavior has on you.
      
      *Example:* "When you smoke in front of me it causes my cravings to become unbearable. Since I really don't want to give in to them, I would like it if you did not smoke in front of me for a while."
      
      **5. Become aware of the reasons you have for NOT asking for help.**
      
      * Are you afraid of disappointing someone?
      * Are you too embarrassed to ask for help?
      * Do you know what to ask for?
      * Do you feel that others have already put a lot of energy into helping you?
      * Are you reluctant to "burden" or "worry" people?
      
      *This is a good one to go over with your individual therapist. These automatic thoughts are often based on your history…experiences in your family, how people have responded to your asking for help in the past…if you have had bad experiences in the past…you may be expecting the same response from everyone. These are important thoughts to challenge and allow yourself to learn to be successful at asking for help.*
