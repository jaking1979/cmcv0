      | Why Don’t I Feel Any Better?   |
      | :---- |
      
      For many people, the decision to stop using substances is a result of a mixture of getting tired of the negatives associated with using, and wanting something better out of day-to-day life. And in fact, when you initially stop using, there is often an immediate improvement in how you feel, look, and act. 
      
      Have any of you noticed these types of improvements?
      
      For many, there is also an expectation by both themselves and those around them that all of life will improve, and that things will keep getting better and better. Many people are surprised when difficulties remain in parts of their lives…and even more surprised when new problems emerge\! It is important to understand that changing old, entrenched behavior is a complicated process, with both positive and negative aspects. As a result, it requires the ability to **TOLERATE** a variety of uncomfortable feelings, which people often underestimate. In this session, we will review the positive and negative results of the changes you are making.
      
      *Have any of you felt surprised by the process…felt better or worse than you expected?*
      
      *Any of you felt pressured by other people’s expectations…expectations that you would just get better?*
      
      Some of you might be making these changes for the first time while others have had previous experience. These types of changes in life, behavior, attitude, and self-image take work and may feel difficult at times; the process, however, does not have to be frightening or intimidating.
      
      *This session is really about the rehab phenomena that we often see.  People get out of rehab, or their first treatment experience and they are full of hope and optimism….it’s like a light bulb went off.  Then after a month or so…real life settles in…the problems that were under the substance use are still there and still painful.  These problems are often the thing that trips people up and causes them to feel it is not worth making changes…we don’t want that to happen to you so we hope you will try to manage your expectations during this process…here are some questions that can help you do that….*
      
      ***For those with prior periods of abstinence or reduced use*****:**  
      1\) What are some of the difficulties you encountered in your day-to-day life while abstinent?
      
      2\) What positive things did you experience in your prior abstinence?
      
      ***For those new to abstinence or reduced use*****:**  
      3\) What positive and what negative experiences do you anticipate as you reduce or discontinue use? (e.g., in your behavior, emotions, lifestyle, etc.)
      
      It is important to discuss the questions above openly. The group can help in “comparing notes” about both expectations and the reality of the changes you are making. Try to benefit from listening to the group talk about their own experiences in expecting too much or too little from the new life they’ve fought to put in place. Having too dismal ***or*** too rosy a picture of your “new life” can lead to disappointment, anger and unfortunately relapse. It can be very helpful to catch this process before it gets the best of you. Below is a list of some areas in which people’s expectations of their new life fail to match with the reality. See if any apply, and create a list for yourself.
      
      * I feel depressed when I expected to feel good.   
      * I feel more confused about my future rather than less confused.  
      * I have more tension in my relationship(s) rather than less.  
      * People are expecting too much of me too fast.  
      * Sex is worse/non-existent rather than better.  
      * Other \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
      
      These discrepancies between expectations and reality can be overwhelming at times, and for some can trigger use. As usual, the first step in preventing them from acting as triggers is to be **AWARE** of them. Starting to come to grips with the reality of your new life and comparing notes with others will help you **TOLERATE** this initial stage of change.   
      
      *Does it help to hear other people talk about their struggles?  We think on of the greatest benefits of self-help groups like 12-step is that it can be really beneficial to sit in a room with other people going through the same thing…it can help normalize the change process and help you not feels so troubled, scared, hopeless.  All the negative feelings that go along with making big life changes are normal….they are just uncomfortable and something that need to be tolerated until you can figure out how to make the changes you need to make to improve your life.  We hope that this session increases your awareness of the need to manage this part of the change process.*
      
      As we have discussed, the decision to come for treatment and the decision to make life changes are both choices for you to make, with costs and benefits for each. These costs and benefits may change over time and need to be re-evaluated to keep this decision fresh and real for you. Take the time to do that reevaluation now. 
      
      For both your decision to come to treatment and your decision to try and change your relationship with substances, briefly list the benefits and costs of these to you at present:
