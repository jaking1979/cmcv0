      *This can be a painful session.  As with many of the topics we try to talk about here, we are not trying to torture you or lecture you about the things you have been dealing with.  We do however, feel it is really important that you have the chance to think through and talk about every issue that may be related to your ability to succeed at changing.

      For many people, trying to change compulsive or addictive behaviors can become an isolated, lonely and vicious struggle. A common experience in this struggle is the repeated attempt to stop or reduce use.  Many want it to be “the last time,” and then find themselves right back at it again the next day, week or year. This pattern is discouraging and demoralizing, and often leads to a sense of failure, shame and self-loathing. In addition, there is a lot of misunderstanding about the process of changing compulsive behaviors, and a tremendous stigma attached to addiction. All of this can easily add up to a powerful desire to isolate and a cutting off from people in your life.
      
      *Have any of you noticed withdrawing from other people, getting more isolated over time? Or becoming removed from some people and not others?*
      
      Another common feature associated with compulsive behaviors is not being truthful.  While this is not something people are proud of, it is an almost inevitable part of managing compulsions. It is very hard to meet the demands of daily living (e.g., job responsibilities, family and social relationships) while at the same time meeting the demands associated with compulsive behaviors. Usually, something has to give. Often, one of the first things to go is the ability to be honest with yourself and/or others.  For example, given the choice, most people would rather tell their boss that they were “out sick” than “crashing from yesterday’s cocaine binge.” Likewise, most people find it easier and less painful to tell themselves, “I’ll be able to cut back on my use” than, “I thought I could stop two years ago, and I still haven’t.”
      
      *How about this phenomena?  Has anyone had to tell lies to manage the consequences of their behavior?  Being hung over etc?*
      
      The problem in not sticking with the truth is that it leaves you isolated and alone. First, you don’t get to talk about your ***real*** life and get help with the actual problems you are facing.  In addition, you may be left with a very painful sense of loneliness and separateness.  In the end, you may end up feeling two things: 1\) you are different and possibly even damaged (e.g., flawed, sick, out of control) and/or 2\) no one ***really*** understands you.
      
      To compound all of this, many people struggle with painful feelings of guilt associated with doing things “wrong.”  Feeling out of control and doing things that are against your value system (lying, avoiding responsibility) are terrible burdens.  Many people decide to return to old behaviors because these feelings erode motivation and oftentimes lead to feelings of hopelessness that negatively impact the change process.
      
      Encourage group to process feelings about these issues.
      
      The central issue to be **AWARE** of is that all of this separateness, lack of being understood, guilt and isolation can add up to deciding to use. In fact, one of the central truths of changing compulsive and addictive behaviors is that it is very tough to do on your own. The degree to which you put up barriers to change (by isolating or not being truthful) is the degree to which it’s just you and your own thoughts and habitual ways of coping.  It is very difficult to come up with alternative ways of interpreting things or coping with life without external feedback or advice. Treatment and change are your choice and for your benefit. It is important to think through these issues so that you can stay connected to both your short- and long-term goals.  
      
      **Questions**   
      1\) Have you had difficulty being honest about your alcohol/drug use (or other compulsive behavior) for any of these reasons?
      
      * You are afraid others (or yourself) would be disappointed in you  
      * You are afraid others (or yourself) would think you are “weak”   
      * You are afraid of real-world consequences (job, relationship loss, etc.)  
      * You feel overwhelmed at the idea of trying to change  
      * You are afraid you ***can’t*** change
      
      2\) Have you found yourself avoiding others who could be supportive of making these life changes?
      
      3\) What behaviors and thoughts can you identify that tell you when you are beginning to isolate?
      
      4\) What strategies can you use to help make the decision not to isolate?
      
      5\) Do you relate to the idea that "If I were stronger, I wouldn't need anyone's help with this anyway"?
      
      **Reminder**  
      Partial truths *also* keep you alone in your own world. Have you noticed that you:
      
      * Decide to let someone believe a partial truth?  
      * Tell people what you think ***they*** want to hear?  
      * Tell people what you ***wish*** were true?
      
      
        *One of the most important coping skills is learning how to **ask for** and **accept** help* 
      
        *from others.  Use the group and your individual therapy to help you identify*
      
         *ways to utilize this skill.*
