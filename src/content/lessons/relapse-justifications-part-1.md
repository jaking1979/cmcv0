      | :---- |
      
      *This is a session about a phenomenon that almost everyone experiences, they just don’t realize what it is…and they don’t realize how it adversely affects their ability to reach their goals.  While we go through this session, keep in mind that this process happens for all behavioral change…everything from substance use to staying on a diet and going to the gym. It’s about the ways that we talk ourselves out of making change.*
      
      Once you have decided to make an effort to stop using alcohol and other drugs, using these substances simply *“because* *I feel like it”* often becomes more difficult. The impulse to use runs into conflict with the decision you have made not to use. With structure and assistance, you can win this struggle and avoid lapsing.
      
      In our experience, however, the impulse to use does not go away that easily, and generates a *process* called ***relapse*** ***justification***. The relapse justification process is an attempt by your “rational brain” to make sense of the very powerful messages it gets from your “primitive brain” urging you to use. As you are pushed by these impulses toward use (through cravings and triggers), the rational brain attempts to provide a *logical explanation* to justify a return to old behaviors. That is, your brain starts to come up with reasons why it may make sense to use a substance. The relapse justification process also includes a *shutting out of information* that could prevent a lapse, with people experiencing a sense that they “just got locked into the thought of using.”
      
      *This process is really based in the brain.  At this point your brain has been exposed to a chemical…or chemicals that it has gotten used to….and possibly dependent upon.  When you remove the chemical…the receptors in your brain that were being affected get agitated for a period of time…and they create physical and psychological discomforts until they get used to not having the chemical that has been affecting them.   Before they get used to it though…they can create a drive to use that is often quite difficult to tolerate.   Your rational brain is only trying to help by finding ways to explain things away so that returning to use (giving your brain the chemical it is used to) makes sense…and the discomfort will go away.* 
      
      *Has anyone ever thought about  this process?*
      
      In addition to being a process, relapse justifications are the “logical” reasons to use that come into your mind. While these reasons typically do not hold up under closer inspection (sometimes after a lapse), they are powerful and compelling when cravings have been activated.  
      
      It is important to be **AWARE** of the relapse justification process *before it occurs*. This awareness includes: (a) knowing that justifications to use will occur and (b) becoming familiar with the justifications themselves. Optimally, at the earliest moment a justification is considered, you will come to recognize it as a justification and dismiss it.  If you wait too long you may close off your mind to thoughts and information that could help you redirect your thinking and behavior.  The more time elapses in this process, the more compelling the “reasons” to return to old behavior can become…often taking on a life of their own. 
      
      *This is an important point and is related to the importance of managing your attention.  These thoughts are totally normal and to be expected.  The trick is to keep them “fleeting” thoughts...in other words not attending to them very long.  The more attention you pay to them…the more you dwell on them…the more they will seem to make sense.*
      
      As you move through the process of making behavior change, it will be helpful to recall justifications that were most convincing to you in the past. Again, recognizing justifications and examining their true nature ahead of time gives you a big advantage when they enter your mind. The following list of relapse justifications is designed to help you identify those that were the most convincing in the past. Identify justifications that sound most familiar, and try to recall the circumstances in which they occurred. Remember, in the future, you may have to react quickly when a justification enters your mind.
      
      **“Accidents” and Other People:**  These types of justifications suggest that you have very little choice in the decision to use, usually because another person is involved or a situation arises seemingly without warning.  
      
      	**1\) It was offered to me.  What could I do?**  
      **2\) An old (using) friend called and we decided to get together.**  
      **3\) I was cleaning my house and found \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I’d forgotten about.**  
      **4\) I had friends for dinner and they unexpectedly brought \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**  
      Examine each of the following justifications and consider the two types of coping:          (a) alternative reactions to the situation or (b) what could have prevented the situation.
      
      *Anyone ever used in response to an “accident”…or used in response to another person in a way that didn’t make sense later?  In hindsight, what could you have done differently? Or how could you have planned ahead and avoided the whole situation?*
      
      **Catastrophic Events:**  Sometimes, one catastrophic event is “reserved” as the justification for relapse. In other words, nothing could possibly lead to a resumption of use except for this one unlikely catastrophic event or situation. Unfortunately, catastrophic events occasionally occur.  
      
      **1\) My spouse/family is angry with me.  There’s no reason not to use.**  
      **2\) I just got injured.  It’s ruined all of my plans.  I might as well use.**  
      **3\) I just lost my job.  Why not?**  
      Think about what type of event would be difficult for you to deal with. Think through the consequences of compounding this event with use.
      
      *Anyone relate to these?  …this is kind of the “rainy day” justification…making the decision to use because you feel bad about some event…as you think through your potential events, think about how using may make the situation worse.*
      
      **For a Specific Purpose:**  These justifications center on the apparent usefulness of alcohol/drug use to accomplish some specific goal.  
      
      	**1\) I’m gaining weight and need \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to control my weight.**		  
      	**2\) I’m out of energy.  I’ll function better with a little \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**  
      	**3\)  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ helps me to meet people.**  
      	**4\) I can’t enjoy sex without \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**		  
      Think about each way you might make similar justifications and consider alternative ways of accomplishing your goal. Consider the frequently counter-productive effect of relying upon alcohol/drugs to serve the purpose stated.
      
      *This is a big one…it is not uncommon to see people move from one substance to another as they try to make changes.  Substances often work very quickly and people get used to getting immediately results…keep in mind that making changes that last over the long haul often requires sustained effort and hard work and unfortunately don’t happen quickly.*
      
      **Depression, Anger and Boredom:**  These justifications suggest that use would be a sensible response to negative emotional states.  
      
      	**1\) I’m depressed.  What difference does it make if I use or not?**  
      **2\) Things can’t get any worse.  I might as well use.**  
      **3\) If he/she thinks I’ve used, I might as well use\!**   
      Reflect on the ultimate consequences of using as a response to negative emotions.  Try to identify situations where you are particularly susceptible to this type of justification and think about ways of preventing or dealing differently with the situation.
      
      *This one is all about not making things worse…if you find yourself using these justifications…remember, even though you may feel bad in the moment, there is a lot of benefit to not making things worse.*
      
      **Remember…**at the time they occur, these justifications will make perfect sense.  It is important not to dwell on them or entertain them, but instead to challenge them.  Since it is difficult to challenge your own thinking, it is often crucial to ask for feedback from people in your support system. It is also very important to review the negative consequences of your use. By recognizing these justifications for what they are (i.e., your rational brain helping your primitive to justify relapsing in order to decrease craving states)…you can protect yourself and maintain a solid connection to your long-term goals.
