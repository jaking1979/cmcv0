      # *This is a quick but very important little session….and it’s all about coping.  Hopefully you have made some progress becoming more aware of your triggers and patterns of use…while that is crucial to changing your patterns.  At the same time, no matter how hard you work to avoid or address triggering situations, there may be a time when you slip off your goals and experience a lapse to old behavior.*  
      
      # 
      
      *We want you to be prepared for these often difficult moments as a lot can happen quickly (your motivation can change, the people in your life may react quickly/negatively, you can be at risk for relapsing in more persistent way etc.)*
      
      # *This idea of thinking through how you will respond to a lapse in advance is really about re-training your brain.  It’s about slowing down and thinking through options and resisting urge to go on auto-pilot when you are exposed to old triggers or use….giving your brain some time to learn that it is ok not to use in response to triggers. As we go through this session, try to assess which of the coping strategies you would be most likely to implement.  We can suggest all sorts of things…but it is ultimately your choice of which seem most reasonable to you.*
      
      **Avoiding Use – What to do**   
      While it may make you uncomfortable to think about how you would handle a slip when you are feeling very committed to your goals, it is one of the most important things you can do.  The process of change can be difficult, and having a personal emergency plan for COPING with high-risk situations (like a slip) can help you get back on board with changing you life.
      
      It is important to develop an emergency plan in case you slip, so that your previously thought out plan can be used at a time when you may not be thinking very clearly. Here are some suggestions for that emergency plan:
      
      **If I experience a lapse:**
      
      * I will put off the decision to drink or use for 15 minutes. I will remember that most cravings are time-limited and that I can wait it out.	
      
      *This is about urge surfing…the idea that cravings don’t last forever in fact some studies suggest that most only last about 15 minutes.  They also tend to go up like the crest of a wave, gradually building and then quickly dropping off if they are not responded to…so, as they seem to be getting worse and worse it is really important to remind yourself that they won’t last forever.  In addition, by not responding to cravings you are teaching your brain the important lesson that it will be ok if you don’t use.*
      
      * I will leave or change the situation/environment and get rid of any remaining drugs or alcohol immediately. 
      
      *While we know this can be difficult sometimes, we recommend that you don’t st*a*y very long in high risk situations.  The longer you linger, the more stimulated you will get.*
      
      * I will realize that one day of drinking or using does not have to turn into a full-blown return to use. 
      
      * I will try not to let feelings of guilt/shame determine my actions because I know they will pass in time. 
      
      * I will challenge my thoughts about drinking and using. Do I really need to drink or use? I will remember why I started to make changes in the first place.
      
      * I will think of something pleasant that is unrelated to drinking/using.	
      
      *This technique is all about distractions…thinking of some activities, engaging with someone else on a topic you enjoy or that is distracting.  The point is to get your thoughts off using…the more you ruminate, the more stimulated you will get.*
      
      * I will remind myself of my successes to this point.
      
      *This is a really important technique as this process can’t all be about avoiding the negatives of using.  It is important to be aware of and attend to the positive things you are hopefully starting to experience by not using.  These are the things that you want to protect that will hopefully hold you through a tough moment…are you relationships starting to improve, are you feeling better physically?*
      
      * I will review the past negative consequences of my use realistically.
      
      *Think through the consequences you have had in the past that made you want to change in the first place.*
      
      * I will call the people on my list of emergency numbers.
      
      *The important thing here is that you need more than 1-2 numbers…and keep in mind that the numbers on your list can include people who don’t even know what you are going through…maybe they are just reliable distracters…people who are funny or engaging.  Remember, try to have a long list of numbers.*
      
      * I will think through *from start to finish* my last episode of using. This includes what I thought would happen at the beginning of that episode, what actually happened, and how I felt at the end of it.
      
      *This technique is often talked about in 12-step communities as “playing back the whole tape”…I have had people write out their last (or most common) experience from start to finish and then review it every so often…have also had people leave themselves voice mail messages of how they felt after their last use.  It is normal to want to forget bad experiences…the problem is…forgetting can cause you to forget why you are doing this in the first place.  Finding a way to remind yourself is very important.*
      
      **YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LAPSE WHILE MAKING CHANGES IN YOUR LIFE. BUT IF YOU DO, REMEMBER: LAPSES ARE ONLY A TEMPORARY DETOUR ON THE ROAD. LEARN FROM THEM AND MOVE ON.**
      
      *Remember, once you have identified the strategies that are most relevant to you, make a point of rehearsing them in your mind…long before you are confronted with a high-risk situation.  You want them to feel comfortable and “part” of you so that they can compete with the strong thoughts of using that may result from being triggered.*  
      **A careful listing of triggers to relapse is critical to help in avoiding a return to old behaviors.**
