      *This is a session about a phenomenon that almost everyone experiences, they just don’t realize what it is…and they don’t realize how it adversely affects their ability to reach their goals.  While we go through this session, keep in mind that this process happens for all behavioral change…everything from substance use to staying on a diet and going to the gym. It’s about the ways that we talk ourselves out of making change.*
      
      Once you have decided to make an effort to stop using alcohol and other drugs, using these substances simply *“because* *I feel like it”* often becomes more difficult. The impulse to use runs into conflict with the decision you have made not to use. With structure and assistance, you can win this struggle and avoid lapsing.
      
      In our experience, however, the impulse to use does not go away that easily, and generates a *process* called ***relapse*** ***justification***. The relapse justification process is an attempt by your “rational brain” to make sense of the very powerful messages it gets from your “primitive brain” urging you to use. As you are pushed by these impulses toward use (through cravings and triggers), the rational brain attempts to provide a *logical explanation* to justify a return to old behaviors. That is, your brain starts to come up with reasons why it may make sense to use a substance. The relapse justification process also includes a *shutting out of information* that could prevent a lapse, with people experiencing a sense that they “just got locked into the thought of using.”
      
      *This process is really based in the brain.  At this point your brain has been exposed to a chemical…or chemicals that it has gotten used to….and possibly dependent upon.  When you remove the chemical…the receptors in your brain that were being affected get agitated for a period of time…and they create physical and psychological discomforts until they get used to not having the chemical that has been affecting them.   Before they get used to it though…they can create a drive to use that is often quite difficult to tolerate.   Your rational brain is only trying to help by finding ways to explain things away so that returning to use (giving your brain the chemical it is used to) makes sense…and the discomfort will go away.* 
      
      *Has anyone ever thought about this process?*
      
      In addition to being a process, relapse justifications are the “logical” reasons to use that come into your mind. While these reasons typically do not hold up under closer inspection (sometimes after a lapse), they are powerful and compelling when cravings have been activated.  
      
      It is important to be **AWARE** of the relapse justification process *before it occurs*. This awareness includes: (a) knowing that justifications to use will occur and (b) becoming familiar with the justifications themselves. Optimally, at the earliest moment a justification is considered, you will come to recognize it as a justification and dismiss it.  If you wait too long you may close off your mind to thoughts and information that could help you redirect your thinking and behavior.  The more time elapses in this process, the more compelling the “reasons” to return to old behavior can become…often taking on a life of their own. 
      
      *thoughts are totally normal and to be expected.  The trick is to keep them “fleeting” thoughts...in other words not attending to them very long.  The more attention you pay to them…the more you dwell on them…the more they will seem to make sense.*
      
      As you move through the process of making behavior change, it will be helpful to recall justifications that were most convincing to you in the past. Again, recognizing justifications and examining their true nature ahead of time gives you a big advantage when they enter your mind. The following list of relapse justifications is designed to help you identify those that were the most convincing in the past. Identify justifications that sound most familiar, and try to recall the circumstances in which they occurred. Remember, in the future, you may have to react quickly when a justification enters your mind.
      
      **Celebration:**  These justifications suggest that use is acceptable for special occasions or when things are going very well.  
      
      	**1\) I’m feeling really good.  One time won’t hurt.**  
      **2\) I’m doing so well.  Things are going great.  I owe myself a reward.**  
      **3\) This is a special event… it deserves a special reward.**
      
      Reflect on circumstances where you justified use in this way.  What was the result of the “celebrating”?   Did things keep going well after celebrating?  Did it actually feel like celebrating?
      
      *Can anyone relate to this one…it’s pretty common since substances often enhance experiences…they are often linked to celebratory events as people feeling good often want to feel even better.  It can be a hard one to talk yourself out of so it is important to think through whether or not making the decision to use at celebrations has really made things better or not in the past.*
      
      **Not a Problem Anymore:**  This category of justifications may not have been significant prior to your decision to enter treatment. They are extremely dangerous, however, after a period of abstinence or success at reaching moderation goals.  If you have been successful at reaching your substance use goals in the past, recall what happened after you returned to old patterns. If this is your first period of significant change, it is important to understand the likelihood of returning to problematic patterns if you resume use, and be ready to reject justifications suggesting otherwise.  
      	  
      **1\) I’m back in control.  I’ll be able to stop when I want to.**  
      **2\) I’ve learned....I’ll only use small amounts and only once in awhile.**
      
      **Testing Yourself:**  This set of justifications suggests that using again will not lead to re-addiction or that you merely want to see if you can handle certain situations. Remember, the justification appears to make sense for a moment. The real reason for using is to get the drug into your brain, and the result of this could well be loss of control and re-addiction.
      
      	**1\)  I’m strong enough to be around \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ now.**  
      **2\)  I just want to use “one more time.”**  
      **3\)  I want to see if I can say “no” to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**  
      **4\)  I want to see if I can be around my old friends.**  
      **5\)  I want to see how \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ feels now that I’ve stopped.**  
      *Think through the times in the past when you tested yourself…how did it work out?*
      
      **Other Drugs and Alcohol:**  These justifications suggest that other drug use is not a problem and can even be useful in controlling your “main drug.” One of the shortest routes back to re-addiction to this “main drug” is by way of other drugs and alcohol. Reflect on the role of other drugs and alcohol in prior relapse episodes.
      
      **1\) I’m having a craving for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  A drink or a joint will calm me.**  
      **2\) My drinking and cocaine weren’t related.  It’s O.K. for me to \_\_\_\_\_.**  
      **3\) My problem is with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, not \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Anyway, you can’t give up everything.**
      
      *Again, it’s not uncommon to see people jump from one substance to another…has anyone tried to give up one thing only to find themselves dependent on something else?*
      
      *The issue here is that any use of a substance is a short term effect that will eventually stop working as your tolerance grows…learning to tolerate your feelings, learning to do things differently requires that you resist the urge to simply use another substance.*
      
      **Remember…**at the time they occur, these justifications will make perfect sense. It is important to not dwell on them or entertain them, but instead to challenge them. Since it is difficult to challenge your own thinking, it is often crucial to ask for feedback from people in your support system. It is also very important to review the negative consequences of your use. By recognizing these justifications for what they are (i.e., your rational brain helping your primitive brain justify relapsing in order to decrease craving states), you can protect yourself and maintain a solid connection to your long-term goals.
