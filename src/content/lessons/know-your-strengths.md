      *This is one of the most important sessions that we do here at CMC.  By the time people seek treatment, many are feeling very demoralized and overwhelmed.  Trying to change on your own and not being successful can make your self-esteem shaky.  This session is about identifying your strengths so that you can use them to change your life.  And we know everyone here has many strengths…so let’s bring them to the surface.*
      
      Making significant life changes can take a long time and be a somewhat complicated process. Since most people have tried to change their use of substances (often unsuccessfully) many times before entering treatment, it is not uncommon to enter treatment with a built up sense of feeling frustrated, hopeless and often helpless.  While not uncommon, these feelings are not the most helpful feelings to focus upon as you try again to change your behavior. At CMC, we feel it is crucially important to recognize your strengths and use them to build your self-confidence as you work toward real life change.
      
      **Your Strengths**  
      Identifying the things you have going for you is crucial in changing behavior patterns.  What personality characteristics can you rely on to help you through the process of making changes? Are you brave, smart, funny, emotionally resilient? Are you good at solving problems? Do you have good people skills?
      
      **Questions to Answer**  
      What are you good at? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
      
      What are you proudest of?  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
      
      What do you think other people like or respect about you? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
      
      You may realize that some things that you are good at or proud of are things you used to do more of in the past. Addiction and substance use is sometimes thought of as “misused energy.” It takes time, energy, and focus to maintain habits.  In thinking about hobbies and other activities, you may realize that over time you have spent less and less time doing things that you really care about as a result of spending time using and/or recovering from using.  This does not mean that you are not still good at the things you used to enjoy or that you can’t reconnect to previous strengths. You may just need some practice\!
      
      One way to increase your confidence is to remind yourself of the ways you have been successful in the past.  What successes have you had in the following areas?
      
      * Work (skills, accomplishments)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

      * Spirituality \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
      
      As you work through this exercise, you may find that you have a lot of mastery in one area to the complete exclusion of other areas (e.g., excellent analytical skills and ability to think through issues but poor communication skills and ability to establish relationships with people).  What strengths can you transfer from one area to another (ability to be a good manager of people at work transferred to being a better communicator with your family)?
      
      Studies have found that confidence or success in one area can in fact transfer to confidence in other areas.  For example, if you feel good about your ability to negotiate at work, you may be able have a greater sense of confidence that you can negotiate better in your relationships at home. In general, recognizing your strengths is an important part of building confidence and self-esteem and will help you make the difficult changes you are trying to implement.
