      | Personal Consequences of Use   |
      | :---- |
      
      In coming to grips with the need for help with substances, it is important to be **AWARE** of the specific ways in which alcohol and/or other drugs have affected your life. Some of these effects have been external (e.g., job performance, family relations), while others have been internal (e.g., feelings of self-hatred and shame). Some of these effects have become apparent to you and others, while some have gone unrecognized or concealed.
      
      *The purpose of this session is to help you all be clear about the two sides of making changes…the positives and the negatives.  Sure, there are consequences you would like to avoid and being really clear about the problems associated with substance use can help you when you start to question whether the changes you are making in your life are worth it.  Ambivalence is totally normal and in the end, it’s how you manage to keep the scale tipped in the direction of change that counts.  This session is not about beating yourself up or feeling bad about your history, it’s about being clear about why you decided to begin making changes in your use in the first place.*
      
      ***The Bad News…Negative Consequences of Use***  
      A helpful way to start this examination is to honestly assess various parts of your life to see if they are going the way you want. Next, consider whether alcohol and/or other drugs are playing a part in your life going that way. For many people, there have been dramatic *negative consequences* that are clearly connected to using. For others, the consequences are less clear. When you use, there can be effects in many areas of your life: in your relationships with your family, friends, co-workers, etc.; in your job/school performance; your legal status; your health and your finances. You may also experience internal consequences associated with your use; these might include feelings of shame or guilt, feelings of hopelessness, a lack of confidence etc.

      *So, why are these bad things not enough?  Why is there such a strong tendency to eventually forget these things and return to behaviors you had decided you wanted to avoid?  Because our human brains are hard wired to forget\!  It’s an evolutionary advantage to forget bad things.  If we remembered every bad or scary thing that happened to us over the course of time we would be crippled with fear or dread.  Forgetting or minimizing negative things is actually what helps us move forward and it’s a great thing except when it makes it difficult to hang on to the reasons why you wanted to change certain behaviors that have negative consequences attached to them*
      
      *In addition, using substances has lots of benefits associated with it.  People have powerful reasons why they start and continue to use substances.  Combine these benefits with the natural tendency to forget negative consequences and most people have trouble maintaining change.  Let’s look at some of these benefits.*
      
      ***The Bad News Part II…Positive Consequences of Use***  
      There is an aspect of substance use that is often overlooked: the *positive consequences* of using. In other words, people use substances for a reason, many of those reasons being very powerful and gratifying. For instance, using may have helped you feel more social. Many people find that when they’re high or intoxicated, they are more outgoing, comfortable and confident with others. They might be more able to take risks and try new things. When sober, they are more likely to feel awkward and shy. Some people use substances to alleviate feelings of depression, loneliness or boredom. In addition, substances are often used to allow or intensify sexuality, or to get past fears related to sex. Last, drinking or using is just plain pleasurable. All of these reasons can make the decision to stop particularly difficult.
      
      What positive **external** consequences of use did you/do you have?
      
      * Provided a group of friends/associates  
      * Facilitated socializing  
      * Gave me a lifestyle/filled my time    
      * Allowed/improved sex life  
      * Made me more productive   
      * Other\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
      
      	  
      What positive **internal** consequences of use did you/do you have?
      
      * Increased feelings of arousal  
      * Lifted my mood  
      * Improved my self-esteem/confidence  
      * Relaxed me socially  
      * Made me feel less lonely  
      * Stress reduction    
      * Feeling of reward  
      * Other\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
      
      *Did anyone notice people’s mood change when they talk about the benefits?  It’s worth noting whether or not you noticed being triggered or somewhat elated as you talk about these things.  It’s a powerful reminder of the power of triggers.  These benefits are why it’s hard to change\!*
      
      *Breaking up is hard to do*…It is natural to feel concerned or upset about giving up some of these positive effects of using. At this early stage, it is also natural to wonder how these will be replaced or *if* they will be replaced. We will discuss the issue of building new activities and lifestyles. However, it is important to acknowledge that despite the “negatives” using has created in your life, you are also giving up something important when you choose to change. We suggest you give this some time to sink in, and then begin to integrate this into the larger picture of what it is you want in your life.

      # **Questions**
      
      1) During abstinence or reduced use, have you noticed yourself remembering the positive aspects of your use more than the negative? Vice-versa?
      
      2) Is it difficult to be honest with the group or others about these positive things you miss?
      
      3) If you have had periods of abstinence in the past, have you tended to “blur” or forget the full picture of what your use was actually like for you?
      
      4) Do you believe there are other ways to feel positively without using?
      
      5) Are you worried about the loss of some of the “positives” discussed above?
      
      *There are several strategies for remembering the negatives.  Write them down, review them daily for a while, or whenever you become aware of remembering the benefits too fondly.*  
      
      *Review the benefits of not using, review what feels better, what changes you want to protect.*
      
      *One of the benefits of going to AA mtgs daily is that you can hear other people talk about their negative consequences.  Many people use other people’s stories as a reminder of their own when they have started to forget.  If you are not going to pursue mtgs then you will need to proactively find a way to remind yourself of the negatives (because they will most certainly fade from you memory) and notice the positive consequences of changing.  Attending to the things that have changed for the better will help you resist the pull of returning to old behaviors.*
