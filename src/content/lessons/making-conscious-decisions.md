      *This session is important at every stage of change….in the beginning… you have to pay attention to almost every detail, as you figure out triggers and coping responses.  In the later stages, being conscious of your decisions will help you protect your hard earned changes.  This is really the session about turning off the “auto-pilot” that is often a apart of substance use…*  
      	  
      Many of the ordinary, mundane choices that are made every day seem to have nothing at all to do with using alcohol and other drugs. It is important, however, to be **AWARE** that although many decisions may not involve making a direct choice about whether to use/drink, they may move you one small step closer to returning to old behaviors. Through a series of minor decisions, you may gradually work your way closer to the point where a return to your old drinking/using patterns becomes very likely.
      
      People often see themselves as passive when it comes to relapse (a return to old patterns of use): “Things just seemed to happen…I ended up in a high-risk situation and then used – it took me by surprise.” What often goes unrecognized is that perhaps dozens of little decisions brought them closer and closer to their eventual use. Because so many choices don’t seem to involve drinking/using at the time, it can be difficult to recognize the connection between current behaviors and thoughts and the role they can play in leading toward use. 
      
      *Has this happened to anyone…have you ever lapsed or returned to old behaviors and not really known how it happened….(allow discussion)*
      
      *So again, this session is so important…the details of your life are the things that add up.  The little decisions that get made throughout the day…that ultimately lead you either toward or away from use.  In the beginning you have to almost be suspect of everything you are doing…which way is the decision taking you? Behavioral habits are very strong…and careful thought is required to break the chain of events you are used to…so, all that being said, how to you break old habits?*  
      
      **What to Do**   
      Returning to old behavior patterns (binge drinking, drug use, restricted eating) does not start at the point you have the drink or drug in your hand. Instead, there are events that lead up to using. It is helpful when you are beginning to make changes to think through almost every choice you have to make, no matter how irrelevant it may seem to drinking/using. By thinking ahead about each possible option you have and where each of them may lead, you can anticipate dangers that may lie along certain paths. These are dangers that you may wish to avoid. While it may feel awkward at first to have to think about the consequences associated with **every** decision, the struggle will eventually become second nature (and therefore less of a struggle\!\!).  With practice it will begin to happen automatically without much effort.  
      
      *So, as we have said, thinking through every decision can be really helpful (even though it can seem tedious)…and this includes little decisions such as…how much sleep and exercise are you getting…what your eating…who you are hanging out with…number of hours you are working…you have to look at how all these variables are connected…and how they are stacking up to put you at risk for either being impulsive or having high cravings to use.*    
      *For example…if you forget to eat lunch during the day…you are probably at risk for inducing a higher level of craving for ETOH at the end of the than if you ate a healthy, balanced lunch.  Many people underestimate how much they crave ETOH simply because their brains are starved for calories.  Are there little things you think you are under estimating?*
      
      By paying attention to your decision making process, you will have a greater chance to interrupt the chain of decisions that could lead to a return to old behaviors. This is important, because it is much easier to stop the process early, before you wind up in a high-risk situation that you needed to avoid. 
      
      ***Eyes open***… Awareness of your internal and external world is a powerful tool in maintaining change…keeping your eyes on the road you have chosen will help protect you from accidents.
      
      **Exercise**  
      Discuss how you are dealing with/planning to deal with the following situations which could typically serve as triggers.  Discuss the ones that are relevant to your situation.  
      
      Remember, there are both short- and long-term solutions to these issues… be sure to think through both.  
         
      1\) Whether to keep liquor in the house/paraphernalia in the home or office (even if hidden from view)
      
      2\) Whether to go to bars with old drinking friends; whether to go certain areas where you used to buy or use drug; whether to go to a party where you know there will be drinking/drugs  
      	  
      3\) Whether to go to a party where people might be using/drinking  
      	  
      4\) What route to use when driving or when going home (e.g., possibly passing an area where you would buy drugs or a liquor store)  
      	  
      5\) Making (or not making) plans for the weekend  
      	  
      6\) Whether to tell people about the changes you are trying to make or keep them a secret  
      	  
      7\) Whether to start conversations with people at non-drinking/using venues (the gym/yoga class, AA/NA meetings, CMC group)  
      	  
      8\) Planning how to spend your free time 
      
      9\) Whether to start an exercise program or make healthy changes in your diet
      
      **Questions**
      
      1\) Have you ever set a goal for reduced use or abstinence and then returned – “out of the blue” – to your old behavior patterns?
      
      2\) What are some warning signs that you are drifting toward old behavior patterns?
      
      3\) What have you done in the past or currently that has worked to protect you from slipping toward old behaviors?
