      Today, let’s talk about how you choose to address your sexual behaviors and sex life while making changes in your substance use patterns. Again, this can be an awkward session, so please feel free to participate as little or much as you want. I hope you will feel comfortable being open and honest with me even if it feels uncomfortable at times. We do this session because often, people who are changing their substance using behavior don’t know (or don’t want to believe) that their sexual behavior has any impact on that struggle.  This session should be an opportunity for you to discuss your sexual health in the context of your efforts to make changes in your substance use. How does that sound to you? 
      
      For many people, discussing sexual behavior is extremely difficult, and often avoided altogether. Because it is such a personal and private topic, it can be frightening and even painful to examine your sexual choices with honesty and without judgment. In an increasingly diverse world, we all hear a variety of messages about sexual behavior, sexual satisfaction, relationships and love from family, friends, and the media.  Add to this the feelings that come with examining your use of substances, and you have a pretty overwhelming combination. At the same time, people often find they are relieved to have a private and non-judgmental space to openly discuss their sexuality in therapy.  Talk about sex with someone you trust can help you to get in touch with your own feelings and values about sex.
      
      How often do you discuss your sexual behavior with total honesty? Who could you or do you discuss it with?  I hope that by creating a safe place in treatment for you to reflect on your sexuality, you can begin to consider how having a satisfying and enjoyable sexual life can be an important part of your overall health and happiness.  Let’s read on about why now?
      
      **Why Talk Sex Now?**  
      
      Though you may be motivated to change your substance use, you may feel that discussing your sex-life is not what you signed up for.  We know that many people who are struggling to change their use of substances actively avoid discussing their sexual choices.  They avoid talking about the relationship between their use of substances and their sex life even more.  Many don’t understand why this topic is so important and feel put on the spot or defensive when the subject comes up.  We hope that you will tolerate this discussion as there is a lot of evidence that thinking through your relationship with sex can be helpful in making larger life changes and in particular changes in your use of substances or engagement in other compulsive behaviors.
      
      In programs like Alcoholics Anonymous, sponsors often instruct participants to abstain from sex and/or new relationships in the first year of sobriety.  While you may agree, disagree, or have no opinion, I want to encourage you to examine the relationship between sex and your substance use. Are you aware of having any particular reaction to this topic?  
      
      **Building AWARENESS**
      
      It is important to be AWARE of your immediate emotional response to discussing this topic as a part of treatment.  People respond to it in different ways: while some people are glad to have the chance to really talk about their sexuality, others dismiss it as irrelevant to their treatment or resort to making jokes or sexually explicit comments to cope with their feelings.  Here are some of the ways people tend to block conversations about their sexual behavior.  We draw your attention to these ways of coping because they tend to shut potentially helpful discussions down and promote avoidance of feelings that may be important to understand.  See if you can identify anyone that might be getting in your way:
      
      **Minimizing:** acknowledging some issues with sexual behavior, but discounting them as either insignificant or unimportant.  This can occur even when a person’s sexual behavior has resulted in negative consequences for their health, safety or intimate relationships.
      
      * I know I got an STD in the past but it can’t happen twice.  
      * I don’t have a sex life so what’s the point of talking about this? 
      
      **Rationalizing:** presenting possible explanations to distance one’s self from responsibility.
      
      * Why does it matter that I relapsed after a date?  It was going to happen at some point anyway.  
      * Everyone drinks on a first date.
      
      **Intellectualizing:** approaching the topic in an impersonal, unemotional way.
      
      * I have thought about the details of the last 3 sexual encounters I’ve had, and I know what I need to do.  
      * I’ve read books about how to improve my sex life and they don’t help.
      
      **Blaming:** focusing on causes for behavior that are outside of yourself and beyond your control.
      
      * My friend shouldn’t have let me leave with that guy.  She knew that I was drunk, and that it’s hard for me to resist going home with someone after a few drinks.
      
      **Hostility:** becoming angry, mean, sullen, temperamental or shaming towards anyone who attempts to talk to you about your sexual behavior.
      
      * Why would I talk to you about my sex life? Don’t you think your curiosity is a bit strange?
      
      **Diversion:** using other issues (either related or unrelated) or making jokes to take the focus off of your sexual behavior.
      
      * I’m really worried about my boyfriend’s sexual behavior, actually…  
      * I think the fact that I don’t remember the girls name is pretty funny..
      
      **Avoidance:** insisting that one’s sexual decisions are not a significant concern in the treatment of their substance use.  Like minimizing, this often occurs even when a person has experienced negative consequences to one or more areas of his or her life.
      
      * My sex life is fine.  It has no bearing on my substance use.  
      * I’m married, so this conversation doesn’t apply to me.
      
      *While these words might seem like jargon, as you look at each description, are there any that feel familiar to you?  How comfortable do you feel having an open discussion about your sexuality and sexual behavior?* 
      
      What’s the Point? Increasing awareness of your sexual behaviors can improve your chances of reaching larger goals around your substance use.  For example:
      
      * Shutting out information, or ignoring your own natural curiosity about sexual behavior, increases the risk of relapse, because you don’t give yourself the opportunity to prepare for triggers that arise in sexual scenarios.  
      
      * Allowing yourself to open up and maybe even feel curious about your sexual behavior is a great first step toward greater awareness.  Being open may also help you discover new things about yourself that may lead to greater satisfaction and increased pleasure.
      
      * By showing interest and exploring your feelings, you can monitor how and when they change, and thoughtfully consider how these behaviors might influence your change process.  
      
      We believe that the more you practice thinking about your sexual decisions in relationship to your substance use, the more likely you are to understand (and therefore change) any of your behaviors or decisions that link sex to drugs or alcohol.  
      
      The ultimate goal is to remove the barriers that stand in the way of AWARENESS.  We want you to be able to improve your sexual decision-making skills and increase the odds that you will reach your larger goals in treatment (e.g., reducing risk of relapse, or improving a relationship).
