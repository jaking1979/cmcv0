      People who struggle with substance use and other compulsive behaviors often tend to have strong judgments about themselves and others. During the process of making significant life changes there are bound to be setbacks. Some people, however, do not experience these setbacks as “problems to be solved” but rather evidence of the fact that they are “worthless,” “stupid,” “weak,” “boring,” “lazy,” or “dirty.”
      
      It is important to be **AWARE** that being extremely critical or judgmental can cause two things to happen:
      
      1. Being unduly critical or rejecting of others can keep you from developing the social support network that ultimately will keep you from drifting toward the compulsive behaviors you are trying to avoid.  
      2. Using negative, hateful judgments to describe yourself can create an internal world of shame and self-contempt.  The worse you feel about yourself, and the more shame and vulnerability you carry around, the more likely drugs/alcohol/ other compulsive behaviors will be an appealing escape.
      
      For many, changing self-destructive behaviors such as abusing alcohol and/or other drugs (in addition to compulsive behaviors such as over/under eating, gambling, and sex) requires that you do something about your negative thinking.  There are three key **COPING** strategies that can help you overcome the influence of critical thoughts.
      
      1. Find core qualities in yourself/others that you value.  
      2. Practice acceptance.  
      3. Reinforce healthy thinking.
      
      **Finding Core Qualities**  
      Review the following items and complete them for yourself or others (depending on the “direction” of your judgments).
      
      * Qualities in you (or others) that are worthy of praise and/or appreciation:
      
      * Qualities in you (or others) that have helped you (or them) survive life’s struggles, pain, dangers:
      
      * Qualities in you (or others) that have helped you reach your goals:
      
      * Qualities in you that have helped you feel happy, proud, or good about yourself:
      
      Be aware that it is not enough to passively recognize positive qualities about yourself or others.  You must actively work to keep them in mind and actively integrate them into your daily life.
      
      **Practice Acceptance**  
      The key to acceptance is to recognize that you are doing the best you can.  For those who tend to be more critical of themselves, it is important to eliminate critical self thoughts with mindful exercises (e.g., for every negative thought, counter with a positive).  
      
      In contrast, for those who tend to be critical and rejecting of others, it is important to pause and make sure you are not making inappropriate assumptions or judgments…judgments that may cause you to reject contact with a person who could add to your life experience (even in a small way\!).
      
      **Reinforce Healthy Thinking**  
      Softening and changing a judgmental or critical attitude toward yourself or others takes committed effort and time.  It is a cognitive habit that needs to be *unlearned.*  Granted, it is a habit that is usually based on emotional pain or frustration with yourself and the emotional lack of responsiveness of others, but it is nonetheless a very important behavior to address in order for positive change to take place.
