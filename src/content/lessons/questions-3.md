      *This can be a tough, awkward session, please feel free to participate as little or much as you want.  We do this session because this topic is such as huge trigger for people.  And it’s a trigger that many people underestimate.  Many just want this part of their life to return to normal and it often does not work that way.  Let’s see how you all do with this topic…*
      
      For many people struggling with alcohol and other drug use, problems with sexuality are often part of the picture. While alcohol or other drugs may have increased sexual confidence, sexual feelings, and performance, this effect usually wears off in the later stages of use. Sexual problems at these later stages are different for different people. Some people are unable to have sexual relations due to their use, while others are unable to have sex without using. For many, sex has either become nonexistent, only associated with use, or compulsive in its own right.
      
      After stopping using, many people continue to experience difficulties with sex as well as intimacy. While these problems may have felt like sexual problems during use, what often emerges after a period of sobriety from substances is a tremendous sense of vulnerability in being either sexually **or** emotionally intimate. For some, this results in anxiety, fearfulness and withdrawal, while others begin a pattern of compulsive sex or relationship-making.
      
      *It’s not uncommon for people to dive into relationships when they try to stop using substances.  New relationships can initially be just as stimulating and distracting as substance use.  The problem however, is that they can also create lots of emotional upset and upheaval and lead to a return to use.  It’s why we want you to think about all sides of this issue.*
      
      Given the complexity of this particular issue, it is important to be **AWARE** that these patterns and responses are normal reactions to a huge change in your life. For many people, drinking or getting high served a very specific function in the area of sex and intimacy: it reduced anxiety and allowed them to feel relaxed, brave, confident and sexual. For others, getting high was what it took to just plain be able to tolerate sex. When you make a decision not to use substances, you are also making a big change in the way you are sexual and intimate. *You are making a decision to be intimate with another person without a chemical chaperone*. At the very least, this is a big change.  For some, however, it can be terrifying, to the point that it feels impossible to tolerate this intimacy.
      
      *Have any of you thought about your substance of choice as a chaperone?  We use this word because many people underestimate the fact that substances create a space between you and another person.  It’s a little buffer to intimacy and you may really notice its absence.  Many people describe feeling overwhelmed with feeling vulnerable of exposed when they try to connect intimately or sexually with another person sober.*
      
      What to do? Making changes in your substance use is a long-term process, and is one that involves changes in many areas of your life, including your sex life. The 12-Step programs often suggest staying out of new relationships for the first year of this major life change. Why? Partly out of a healthy respect for how difficult and disruptive it can be to manage an intimate relationship in this new “skin.” Deciding whether or not to address your sex life or pursue intimate relationship is just one of the many decisions you will have to make in the process of change.  
      
      Making significant life changes can require that you establish or re-establish intimacy with the important people in your life. For many, it is important to set the goal of having a meaningful and satisfying sex life. What seems important at this moment in time, however, is to go at a pace that seems manageable.  Keep in mind that when it comes to relationships, getting a feel for this pace can be very difficult to do without some major upheavals. Relationships and sex can seem very alluring when you are trying to reduce or give up your “relationship” with alcohol and/or drugs.  We strongly encourage you to walk rather than run in this area for now, and to trust that it will get better in time. 
      
      Thinking it through: Making lasting positive change is best accomplished when you can get emotional support in your life for these changes. This is not only a “nice” idea, but also one that is supported by research findings in this area. The trick can be to begin to understand for ***yourself*** and for ***your life*** what emotional support and closeness mean to you.
