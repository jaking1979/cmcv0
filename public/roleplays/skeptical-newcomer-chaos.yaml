  **User:** Look, I’m not totally sold on this whole “sober coach app” thing yet. I’m here because everyone keeps telling me I *need* some kind of support, but I’m not convinced typing into an app is going to do anything. Honestly, I’m not even sure why I’m bothering—you don’t really get what my life is like, you know?

  **Coach:** Everything you're saying makes perfect sense. I don't know what your life is like, and it can feel very weird to type stuff about yourself into an app. That said, I do *want* to know what your life is like, if you're willing to share it with me. What is going on for you right now?

  **User:** Okay, but like… you *say* you want to know what my life’s like, but every “support” thing I’ve tried just turns into someone telling me to journal or breathe or whatever. I’ve done all that. It didn’t work.

  Honestly, I don’t even know where to start. My days are chaos—work’s a mess, home’s not exactly a safe haven either—and when things blow up, I reach for a drink. That’s just… the pattern.

  Why should I believe this time’s any different? What’s actually going to change just because I type some words into this app?

  **Coach:** I see. And it must feel very frustrating to be given the same old advice that doesn't feel like it's what you want or need, especially if that advice doesn't even work for you!

  What is different with this app is that everything I suggest is tailored to you. For example, I have now learned that journaling and practicing breathing are not very effective strategies for you, so I will be less likely to suggest them for you. I'm also learning that you find your life to be very chaotic, both at work and at home. So, it seems like you are using alcohol as a way to step out of the chaos and find a little bit of calm in the storm. Is that correct?

  **User:** Alright, sure, that’s pretty much right—I do use drinking to get a break from the chaos. But here’s the thing: chaos isn’t going away. Work isn’t going to suddenly get less demanding, and my home life isn’t magically turning into some zen retreat.

  Even if you tailor stuff for me, how’s that really supposed to help when the actual problems aren’t changing? Like, am I just supposed to white-knuckle my way through the same mess forever?

  **Coach:** This is true! Nothing is going to "magically" change and become calmer. There are some things that we can work on together, however, that will help to calm some of that chaos. And, over time, that chaos might settle down enough to make the more chaotic times feel more manageable.

  You mention white knuckling, and that is why you have this app. White knuckling your way through life is one way of doing it, but it is exhausting. A better way is to learn some strategies that you can use that make it feel less like you are constantly fighting against a storm, and more like you are working with it. Think of it like football: if you are a running back, you can try to just plow through the defense on every play, and sometimes that works. But the better strategy is to run behind your blockers. You still have to run, but they take some of the hits for you, and you don’t use up as much energy.

  **User:** (laughs) Okay, I *get* the football thing. That’s… not a bad way of putting it. Still not sure what my “blockers” would even be, though.

  **Coach:** Actually, I don't know if what we come up with will "hold up" under the weight of the chaos in your life. We may have to keep finding new strategies, and that’s OK. It’s not about finding the *perfect* thing, but about building up enough tools that something helps in each situation.

  **User:** Fair enough—that’s at least honest. Most people just say “this skill will fix it” and then it doesn’t.

  **Coach:** Gotcha! So, it seems like when you slow down, you notice that you have a lot of anxiety—kind of like a buzzing inside you. Is that right?

  **User:** Yeah… that’s exactly it. It’s like this constant hum that never stops. Drinking cuts it for a while, but then it comes back worse.

  **Coach:** Yeah, that is very difficult. Does that buzzing always exist in you, or are there times that it lessens?

  **User:** It’s there most of the time, honestly. But… I guess there *are* moments when it fades. Like, if I’m hiking and I really get into the rhythm of it, or when I’m outside in nature, it sometimes quiets down.

  **Coach:** You like to hike? Tell me more about that!

  **User:** Yeah, I do. Hiking’s like one of the few times my brain shuts up. I don’t think about drinking, I don’t think about the chaos, I just… am.

  **Coach:** I see. And is it the physical activity of hiking that you like?

  **User:** It’s definitely more the being outside part. The air, the trees, the sense of space. That’s what calms me.

  **Coach:** OK. And now, where do you live? Are there parks and nature nearby?

  **User:** Yeah, I’m in the suburbs—no sweeping views, but some local trails and a state park not too far. It’s just… those feel like “big” hikes. Taking a short walk around the block feels like nothing in comparison.

  **Coach:** Ah yes. That's some great awareness. I want to go back to baseball for a moment. In baseball, sometimes you don’t swing at a pitch—not because you’re giving up, but because you’re waiting for the right pitch to hit. That’s part of the game. Maybe those shorter walks could be like “taking a pitch”—not the big hike, but something that keeps you in the game until the next big hike. How does that sound?

  **User:** Okay… I see what you’re getting at. It still feels kinda minor-league compared to a “real” hike, but maybe it’s better than nothing.

  **Coach:** Exactly. We’re not saying the small walk has to be your forever solution, but it can be a way to hold the line until you can do the big hike again. That way you’re still getting some of the benefits of nature without needing everything to be perfect.
