  **User:** Uh… so, I don’t even know if this is the right place for me. I mean, yeah, I party, but it’s not like I’m using every single day or anything. But… lately, it feels like it’s creeping in more and more. I tell myself I’m not going to, and then the next thing I know, I’m doing it again. I feel like I’m breaking promises to myself, over and over.

  **Coach:** That is a great question. You said you feel like you might be losing control? Tell me about a time when you told yourself you weren’t going to use, but ended up doing it anyway.

  **User:** Yeah… like, last week I told myself I wasn’t going to touch anything. But then Friday rolled around, and we were all hanging out, and somebody pulled out a bag, and… I don’t know. I just couldn’t say no. And then the whole weekend felt like a blur. Afterwards, I was mad at myself, but in the moment, it felt impossible to resist.

  **Coach:** OK. It seems like things really got away from you and you don't know exactly what happened that led you from saying you wouldn’t use, to using. Is it okay if we replay that night and see if we can spot the decision points together?

  **User:** Yeah… I’m okay with that, I guess.

  **Coach:** Well, let's start out a bit earlier. What was going on in the hours before you went out? How were you feeling?

  **User:** Honestly, the few days before that night were brutal—exams, projects, barely sleeping. By Friday, I was exhausted, but also kind of wired. Like, too tired to think straight, but too stressed to relax.

  **Coach:** OK! So you were already feeling stressed out and worn down, and then Friday comes, and you’re already in a fragile spot. And then what happened?

  **User:** It was just a few friends hanging out, not some huge party. We were playing video games, messing around. I wasn’t planning on anything heavy happening.

  **Coach:** OK, so you were there, kind of expecting (and maybe hoping for) a chill night. Then someone pulled out the drugs?

  **User:** Yeah. They pulled out a little bag of cocaine, and suddenly it wasn’t just hanging out anymore. My brain lit up, like, “oh man, here we go.” I told myself, “just one bump,” but you know how that goes. One turned into more, and then the whole night slipped away.

  **Coach:** I see. So they pulled out the cocaine, and you felt like “here we go.” And that first bump probably gave you exactly what you wanted in that moment: relief from stress, energy, and a sense of fun. Is that right?

  **User:** Yeah… that’s exactly it. The first bump made me feel alive again, like I could keep going, like I was fun again. But then hours later, I was crashing hard, and the regret started creeping in.

  **Coach:** I'm sure it did! Taking that first bump probably did exactly what you wanted—gave you energy, made you feel fun—but the crash and regret came after. That’s the tricky part: it works in the short term, but the long-term effects feel terrible.

  **User:** Yeah… it definitely gave me that rush at first, but the fallout sucks. I don’t like waking up feeling like I failed myself again.

  **Coach:** Yeah. That does sound exhausting—caught between wanting the immediate relief and hating the aftermath. Has anyone in your group managed to resist in those moments?

  **User:** Yeah, there was one guy—Ben—who didn’t touch it all night. He just chilled, played games, laughed, had a good time without any of it. I don’t get how he does that.

  **Coach:** Tell me about Ben.

  **User:** Ben’s kind of the steady one in our group. He doesn’t judge anyone, but he doesn’t give in either. People respect him. Honestly, I respect him. He doesn’t make a big deal about it, he just… doesn’t join in.

  **Coach:** Ben sounds like an interesting guy! And it seems like you really respect him. Do you feel close with Ben?

  **User:** Yeah, I’d say we’re pretty close. We’ve had some deep talks before, just not about this.

  **Coach:** Have you ever talked to Ben about how he handles situations like that?

  **User:** Not really. I guess I worry it’d be awkward, like I’m confessing I can’t handle myself.

  **Coach:** Well, I'm an AI bot, so I don't "see" much of anything! :-) But I do know that people often ask for help and advice about a bunch of things, and it usually brings people closer together, not further apart or makes things awkward between them.

  **User:** Honestly… no, I haven’t asked him. I’ve been too worried it’d make me look weak.

  **Coach:** What if you didn't have to go quite so far? Like, what if you didn’t have to say that you’re not in control, but rather you just talked about situations like that. Like saying that it’s hard when everyone is taking bumps, and then you feel like you have to, but you’ve seen that he doesn’t and you’re wondering how he does that? That way you’re not saying that you have “a problem,” or that you aren’t in control. You’re just asking about technique. Similar to asking about how he handles a difficult situation in a soccer match.

  **User:** That… actually makes a lot of sense. If I frame it like that, it’s not a confession, it’s just curiosity. And Ben’s the kind of guy who’d probably give me a straight answer.

  **Coach:** That sounds like a great start! And it will help get you one ally, a person who you might be able to turn to in those moments and know is on your side.

  **User:** Yeah… you’re right. Having someone like Ben in my corner would make it easier to resist.

  Highlights ally (Ben), shifts “confession” to “asking for technique,” builds hope via peer modeling.
