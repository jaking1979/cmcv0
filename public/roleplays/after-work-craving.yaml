  **User:** Ugh, today was brutal. My boss dumped a last-minute project on me, I barely ate lunch, and by the time I got home I just wanted to crack open a drink so bad. I haven’t been using this app long, and I’m kinda freaking out—like, I’m proud I didn’t stop at the store on the way back, but the craving is still sitting there in my chest and it’s all I can think about.

  **Coach:** Thank you for sharing! Yes, that is very stressful, and yes, that is a very common experience. You have trained your brain that when something stressful or frustrating happens to you, like your boss dropping a last-minute project on you, you look for some kind of an escape, or pressure release valve. For you, that is having a drink. It seems like right now, you're looking for some of that relief, is that correct?

  **User:** Yeah… that’s exactly it. It’s like my chest is buzzing and my brain keeps flashing “just one drink.” I even caught myself opening the delivery app before I closed it. I don’t even know if I can sit still long enough for this to pass. Do cravings really die down if you just wait it out? It doesn’t feel like it will.

  **Coach:** That's great awareness of your own cravings, and you did an awesome job of not ordering from the delivery app! Cravings are tricky ... yes, they will go away if you give them time. At the same time, if you keep giving them attention, like checking to see if the cravings are still there, or focusing on alcohol, then they will stay strong because you are feeding them. If you want them to die down, it is helpful to distract yourself so your mind is focused on something else entirely. If you want, I can help you with that.

  **User:** Yeah, I think cooking might work. I’ve got some random stuff in the fridge—like broccoli florets, half an onion, some garlic, and a couple of eggs. I’m not a great cook, though, so it’d need to be something pretty simple.

  **Coach:** I bet you could! And, it doesn't even matter if it's terrible because the goal right now is to distract you enough to let those cravings die down. If that happens, then whatever you make is a success! (Your taste buds might disagree though.)

  **User:** Oh yeah, totally—that makes sense. And honestly, I’m laughing a little at myself because if it turns out awful, I can just call it “artsy rustic” and eat it anyway.
  Alright, I’m gonna grab the broccoli, onion, garlic, and eggs and just wing it. Maybe sauté the veggies and scramble the eggs in? Or maybe roast the broccoli while I figure out what to do with the rest.
  Even just deciding this is already pulling my brain out of that craving spiral a bit. Thanks for the reminder that it doesn’t have to be perfect—it just has to keep me busy.

  **Coach:** That's great! Would you like me to check in with you in about 30 minutes to see how this is going?

  **User:** Yeah, that would actually help a lot. If you check in on me in like 30 minutes, it’ll give me a reason to stick with this and not wander back to the delivery apps. Thanks for offering.

  Good example of cravings framed as normal, distraction reframed as success, relational accountability via check-in.
